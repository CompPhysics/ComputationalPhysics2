===== Brief reminder on Newton-Raphson's method =====

Let us quickly remind ourselves on how we derive the above method.

Perhaps the most celebrated of all one-dimensional root-finding
routines is Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson
method. This method  requires the evaluation of both the
function $f$ and its derivative $f'$ at arbitrary points. 
If you can only calculate the derivative
numerically and/or your function is not of the smooth type, we
normally discourage the use of this method.

!split
===== The equations =====

The Newton-Raphson formula consists geometrically of extending the
tangent line at a current point until it crosses zero, then setting
the next guess to the abscissa of that zero-crossing.  The mathematics
behind this method is rather simple. Employing a Taylor expansion for
$x$ sufficiently close to the solution $s$, we have


!bt
\[
    f(s)=0=f(x)+(s-x)f'(x)+\frac{(s-x)^2}{2}f''(x) +\dots.
    \label{eq:taylornr}
\]
!et

For small enough values of the function and for well-behaved
functions, the terms beyond linear are unimportant, hence we obtain


!bt
\[
   f(x)+(s-x)f'(x)\approx 0,
\]
!et
yielding
!bt
\[
   s\approx x-\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}.
\]
!et

Having in mind an iterative procedure, it is natural to start iterating with
!bt
\[
   x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Simple geometric interpretation =====

The above is Newton-Raphson's method. It has a simple geometric
interpretation, namely $x_{n+1}$ is the point where the tangent from
$(x_n,f(x_n))$ crosses the $x$-axis.  Close to the solution,
Newton-Raphson converges fast to the desired result. However, if we
are far from a root, where the higher-order terms in the series are
important, the Newton-Raphson formula can give grossly inaccurate
results. For instance, the initial guess for the root might be so far
from the true root as to let the search interval include a local
maximum or minimum of the function.  If an iteration places a trial
guess near such a local extremum, so that the first derivative nearly
vanishes, then Newton-Raphson may fail totally


!split
===== Extending to more than one variable =====

Newton's method can be generalized to systems of several non-linear equations
and variables. Consider the case with two equations
!bt
\[
   \begin{array}{cc} f_1(x_1,x_2) &=0\\
                     f_2(x_1,x_2) &=0,\end{array}
\]
!et
which we Taylor expand to obtain

!bt
\[
   \begin{array}{cc} 0=f_1(x_1+h_1,x_2+h_2)=&f_1(x_1,x_2)+h_1
                     \partial f_1/\partial x_1+h_2
                     \partial f_1/\partial x_2+\dots\\
                     0=f_2(x_1+h_1,x_2+h_2)=&f_2(x_1,x_2)+h_1
                     \partial f_2/\partial x_1+h_2
                     \partial f_2/\partial x_2+\dots
                       \end{array}.
\]
!et
Defining the Jacobian matrix $\hat{J}$ we have
!bt
\[
 \hat{J}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
                         \partial f_1/\partial x_1  & \partial f_1/\partial x_2 \\
                          \partial f_2/\partial x_1     &\partial f_2/\partial x_2
             \end{array} \right),
\]
!et
we can rephrase Newton's method as
!bt
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1^{n+1} \\ x_2^{n+1} \end{array} \right)=
\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1^{n} \\ x_2^{n} \end{array} \right)+
\left(\begin{array}{c} h_1^{n} \\ h_2^{n} \end{array} \right),
\]
!et
where we have defined
!bt
\[
   \left(\begin{array}{c} h_1^{n} \\ h_2^{n} \end{array} \right)=
   -{\bf \hat{J}}^{-1}
   \left(\begin{array}{c} f_1(x_1^{n},x_2^{n}) \\ f_2(x_1^{n},x_2^{n}) \end{array} \right).
\]
!et
We need thus to compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix and it
is to understand that difficulties  may
arise in case $\hat{J}$ is nearly singular.

It is rather straightforward to extend the above scheme to systems of
more than two non-linear equations. In our case, the Jacobian matrix is given by the Hessian that represents the second derivative of cost function. 


!split
===== Steepest descent =====

The basic idea of gradient descent is
that a function $F(\mathbf{x})$, 
$\mathbf{x} \equiv (x_1,\cdots,x_n)$, decreases fastest if one goes from $\bf {x}$ in the
direction of the negative gradient $-\nabla F(\mathbf{x})$.

It can be shown that if 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k),
\]
!et
with $\gamma_k > 0$.

For $\gamma_k$ small enough, then $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq
F(\mathbf{x}_k)$. This means that for a sufficiently small $\gamma_k$
we are always moving towards smaller function values, i.e a minimum.

!split 
===== More on Steepest descent =====

The previous observation is the basis of the method of steepest
descent, which is also referred to as just gradient descent (GD). One
starts with an initial guess $\mathbf{x}_0$ for a minimum of $F$ and
computes new approximations according to

!bt
\[
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k), \ \ k \geq 0.
\]
!et

The parameter $\gamma_k$ is often referred to as the step length or
the learning rate within the context of Machine Learning.

!split 
===== The ideal =====

Ideally the sequence $\{\mathbf{x}_k \}_{k=0}$ converges to a global
minimum of the function $F$. In general we do not know if we are in a
global or local minimum. In the special case when $F$ is a convex
function, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case
gradient descent can converge to the global solution. The advantage of
this scheme is that it is conceptually simple and straightforward to
implement. However the method in this form has some severe
limitations:

In machine learing we are often faced with non-convex high dimensional
cost functions with many local minima. Since GD is deterministic we
will get stuck in a local minimum, if the method converges, unless we
have a very good intial guess. This also implies that the scheme is
sensitive to the chosen initial condition.

Note that the gradient is a function of $\mathbf{x} =
(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ which makes it expensive to compute numerically.


!split 
===== The sensitiveness of the gradient descent ===== 

The gradient descent method 
is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\gamma_k$. This is due
to the fact that we are only guaranteed that $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq
F(\mathbf{x}_k)$ for sufficiently small $\gamma_k$. The problem is to
determine an optimal learning rate. If the learning rate is chosen too
small the method will take a long time to converge and if it is too
large we can experience erratic behavior.

Many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by introducing
randomness. One such method is that of Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), see below.


!split 
===== Convex functions ===== 

Ideally we want our cost/loss function to be convex(concave).

First we give the definition of a convex set: A set $C$ in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be convex if, for all $x$ and $y$ in $C$ and
all $t \in (0,1)$ , the point $(1 âˆ’ t)x + ty$ also belongs to
C. Geometrically this means that every point on the line segment
connecting $x$ and $y$ is in $C$ as discussed below.

The convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals of
$\mathbb{R}$. Examples of convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ are the
regular polygons (triangles, rectangles, pentagons, etc...).

!split
===== Convex function =====

_Convex function_: Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex set. Assume that the function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f$ is said to be convex if $$f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) $$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and for all $t \in [0,1]$. If $\leq$ is replaced with a strict inequaltiy in the definition, we demand $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $t\in(0,1)$ then $f$ is said to be strictly convex. For a single variable function, convexity means that if you draw a straight line connecting $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, the value of the function on the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is always below the line as illustrated below.

!split
===== Conditions on convex functions =====

In the following we state first and second-order conditions which
ensures convexity of a function $f$. We write $D_f$ to denote the
domain of $f$, i.e the subset of $R^n$ where $f$ is defined. For more
details and proofs we refer to: "S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe. Convex Optimization. Cambridge University Press":"http://stanford.edu/boyd/cvxbook/, 2004".

!bblock First order condition
Suppose $f$ is differentiable (i.e $\nabla f(x)$ is well defined for
all $x$ in the domain of $f$). Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$
is a convex set and $$f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y-x) $$ holds
for all $x,y \in D_f$. This condition means that for a convex function
the first order Taylor expansion (right hand side above) at any point
a global under estimator of the function. To convince yourself you can
make a drawing of $f(x) = x^2+1$ and draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ and
note that it is always below the graph.  
!eblock

!bblock Second order condition 
Assume that $f$ is twice
differentiable, i.e the Hessian matrix exists at each point in
$D_f$. Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$ is a convex set and its
Hessian is positive semi-definite for all $x\in D_f$. For a
single-variable function this reduces to $f''(x) \geq 0$. Geometrically this means that $f$ has nonnegative curvature
everywhere.
!eblock

This condition is particularly useful since it gives us an procedure for determining if the function under consideration is convex, apart from using the definition.

!split
===== More on convex functions =====

The next result is of great importance to us and the reason why we are
going on about convex functions. In machine learning we frequently
have to minimize a loss/cost function in order to find the best
parameters for the model we are considering. 

Ideally we want the
global minimum (for high-dimensional models it is hard to know
if we have local or global minimum). However, if the cost/loss function
is convex the following result provides invaluable information:

!bblock Any minimum is global for convex functions
Consider the problem of finding $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(x)$
is minimal, where $f$ is convex and differentiable. Then, any point
$x^*$ that satisfies $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ is a global minimum.
!eblock

This result means that if we know that the cost/loss function is convex and we are able to find a minimum, we are guaranteed that it is a global minimum.

!split
===== Some simple problems =====

o Show that $f(x)=x^2$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ using the definition of convexity. Hint: If you re-write the definition, $f$ is convex if the following holds for all $x,y \in D_f$ and any $\lambda \in [0,1]$ $\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)-f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y ) \geq 0$.

o Using the second order condition show that the following functions are convex on the specified domain.
 * $f(x) = e^x$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
 * $g(x) = -\ln(x)$ is convex for $x \in (0,\infty)$.
o Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = e^x$. Show that $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Also show that if $f(x)$ is any convex function than $h(x) = e^{f(x)}$ is convex.

o A norm is any function that satisfy the following properties
 * $f(\alpha x) = |\alpha| f(x)$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
 * $f(x+y) \leq f(x) + f(y)$
 * $f(x) \leq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with equality if and only if $x = 0$

Using the definition of convexity, try to show that a function satisfying the properties above is convex (the third condition is not needed to show this).


!split
===== Standard steepest descent =====


Before we proceed, we would like to discuss the approach called the
_standard Steepest descent_, which again leads to us having to be able
to compute a matrix. It belongs to the class of Conjugate Gradient methods (CG).

"The success of the CG method":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf"
for finding solutions of non-linear problems is based on the theory
of conjugate gradients for linear systems of equations. It belongs to
the class of iterative methods for solving problems from linear
algebra of the type 
!bt 
\begin{equation*} 
\hat{A}\hat{x} = \hat{b}.
\end{equation*} 
!et 

In the iterative process we end up with a problem like

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{r}= \hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x},
\end{equation*}
!et
where $\hat{r}$ is the so-called residual or error in the iterative process.

When we have found the exact solution, $\hat{r}=0$.

!split
===== Gradient method =====

The residual is zero when we reach the minimum of the quadratic equation
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  P(\hat{x})=\frac{1}{2}\hat{x}^T\hat{A}\hat{x} - \hat{x}^T\hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et

with the constraint that the matrix $\hat{A}$ is positive definite and
symmetric.  This defines also the Hessian and we want it to be  positive definite.  


!split
===== Steepest descent  method ===== 

We denote the initial guess for $\hat{x}$ as $\hat{x}_0$. 
We can assume without loss of generality that
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_0=0,
\end{equation*}
!et
or consider the system
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{A}\hat{z} = \hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_0,
\end{equation*}
!et
instead.


!split
===== Steepest descent  method ===== 
!bblock
One can show that the solution $\hat{x}$ is also the unique minimizer of the quadratic form
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  f(\hat{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\hat{x}^T\hat{A}\hat{x} - \hat{x}^T \hat{x} , \quad \hat{x}\in\mathbf{R}^n. 
\end{equation*}
!et
This suggests taking the first basis vector $\hat{r}_1$ (see below for definition) 
to be the gradient of $f$ at $\hat{x}=\hat{x}_0$, 
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{A}\hat{x}_0-\hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and 
$\hat{x}_0=0$ it is equal $-\hat{b}$.

!eblock

!split
===== Final expressions ===== 
!bblock
We can compute the residual iteratively as
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_{k+1}=\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_{k+1},
 \end{equation*}
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{b}-\hat{A}(\hat{x}_k+\alpha_k\hat{r}_k),
 \end{equation*}
!et
or
!bt
\begin{equation*}
(\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_k)-\alpha_k\hat{A}\hat{r}_k,
 \end{equation*}
!et
which gives

!bt
\[
\alpha_k = \frac{\hat{r}_k^T\hat{r}_k}{\hat{r}_k^T\hat{A}\hat{r}_k}
\]
!et
leading to the iterative scheme
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_{k+1}=\hat{x}_k-\alpha_k\hat{r}_{k},
 \end{equation*}
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Our simple $2\times 2$ example =====

Last week we introduced the simple two-dimensional function
!bt
\[
f(x_1,x_2)=x_1^2+x_1x_2+10x_2^2-5x_1-3x_2,
\]
!et
which is of the form (in terms of vectors and matrices)
!bt
\[
f(\bm{x})=\frac{1}{2}\bm{x}^T\bm{A}\bm{x}-\bm{b}^T\bm{x},
\]
!et
where we have
!bt
\[
\bm{x}=\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\bm{b}=\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 3\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1\\ 1& 20\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Derivatives and more =====

Optimizing the above equation, that is
!bt
\[
\nabla f = 0 = \bm{A}\bm{x}-\bm{b},
\]
!et
which leads to a simple matrix-inversion problem
!bt
\[
\bm{x}=\bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}.
\]
!et
This problem is easy to solve since we can calculate the inverse. Alternatively, we can solve the two coupled equations with two unknowns
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}=2x_1+x_2-5=0,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}=x_1+20x_2-3=0,
\]
!et
with solutions $x_1=97/39$ and $x_2=1/39$.

===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
In the CG method we define so-called conjugate directions and two vectors 
$\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$
are said to be
conjugate if
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{s}^T\hat{A}\hat{t}= 0.
\end{equation*}
!et
The philosophy of the CG method is to perform searches in various conjugate directions
of our vectors $\hat{x}_i$ obeying the above criterion, namely
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_i^T\hat{A}\hat{x}_j= 0.
\end{equation*}
!et
Two vectors are conjugate if they are orthogonal with respect to 
this inner product. Being conjugate is a symmetric relation: if $\hat{s}$ is conjugate to $\hat{t}$, then $\hat{t}$ is conjugate to $\hat{s}$.
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
An example is given by the eigenvectors of the matrix
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{v}_i^T\hat{A}\hat{v}_j= \lambda\hat{v}_i^T\hat{v}_j,
\end{equation*}
!et
which is zero unless $i=j$. 
!eblock


!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
Assume now that we have a symmetric positive-definite matrix $\hat{A}$ of size
$n\times n$. At each iteration $i+1$ we obtain the conjugate direction of a vector
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_{i+1}=\hat{x}_{i}+\alpha_i\hat{p}_{i}. 
\end{equation*}
!et
We assume that $\hat{p}_{i}$ is a sequence of $n$ mutually conjugate directions. 
Then the $\hat{p}_{i}$  form a basis of $R^n$ and we can expand the solution 
$  \hat{A}\hat{x} = \hat{b}$ in this basis, namely

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{x}  = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i \hat{p}_i.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
The coefficients are given by
!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i \mathbf{A} \mathbf{p}_i = \mathbf{b}.
\end{equation*}
!et
Multiplying with $\hat{p}_k^T$  from the left gives

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{p}_k^T \hat{A}\hat{x} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i\hat{p}_k^T \hat{A}\hat{p}_i= \hat{p}_k^T \hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and we can define the coefficients $\alpha_k$ as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_k = \frac{\hat{p}_k^T \hat{b}}{\hat{p}_k^T \hat{A} \hat{p}_k}
\end{equation*}
!et 
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method and iterations ===== 
!bblock

If we choose the conjugate vectors $\hat{p}_k$ carefully, 
then we may not need all of them to obtain a good approximation to the solution 
$\hat{x}$. 
We want to regard the conjugate gradient method as an iterative method. 
This will us to solve systems where $n$ is so large that the direct 
method would take too much time.

We denote the initial guess for $\hat{x}$ as $\hat{x}_0$. 
We can assume without loss of generality that
!bt

===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
One can show that the solution $\hat{x}$ is also the unique minimizer of the quadratic form
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  f(\hat{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\hat{x}^T\hat{A}\hat{x} - \hat{x}^T \hat{x} , \quad \hat{x}\in\mathbf{R}^n. 
\end{equation*}
!et
This suggests taking the first basis vector $\hat{p}_1$ 
to be the gradient of $f$ at $\hat{x}=\hat{x}_0$, 
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{A}\hat{x}_0-\hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and 
$\hat{x}_0=0$ it is equal $-\hat{b}$.
The other vectors in the basis will be conjugate to the gradient, 
hence the name conjugate gradient method.

===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
Let  $\hat{r}_k$ be the residual at the $k$-th step:
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_k=\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_k.
\end{equation*}
!et
Note that $\hat{r}_k$ is the negative gradient of $f$ at 
$\hat{x}=\hat{x}_k$, 
so the gradient descent method would be to move in the direction $\hat{r}_k$. 
Here, we insist that the directions $\hat{p}_k$ are conjugate to each other, 
so we take the direction closest to the gradient $\hat{r}_k$  
under the conjugacy constraint. 
This gives the following expression
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{p}_{k+1}=\hat{r}_k-\frac{\hat{p}_k^T \hat{A}\hat{r}_k}{\hat{p}_k^T\hat{A}\hat{p}_k} \hat{p}_k.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
We can also  compute the residual iteratively as
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_{k+1}=\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_{k+1},
 \end{equation*}
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{b}-\hat{A}(\hat{x}_k+\alpha_k\hat{p}_k),
 \end{equation*}
!et
or
!bt
\begin{equation*}
(\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_k)-\alpha_k\hat{A}\hat{p}_k,
 \end{equation*}
!et
which gives

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_{k+1}=\hat{r}_k-\hat{A}\hat{p}_{k},
 \end{equation*}
!et

    x += t*v
    r -= t*z;
    d = r.T @ r

      break
    v = r + (d/c)*v

===== Broydenâ€“Fletcherâ€“Goldfarbâ€“Shanno algorithm =====
!bblock
The optimization problem is to minimize $f(\mathbf {x} )$ where $\mathbf {x}$  is a vector in $R^{n}$, and $f$ is a differentiable scalar function. There are no constraints on the values that  $\mathbf {x}$  can take.

The algorithm begins at an initial estimate for the optimal value $\mathbf {x}_{0}$ and proceeds iteratively to get a better estimate at each stage.

The search direction $p_k$ at stage $k$ is given by the solution of the analogue of the Newton equation
!bt
\[
B_{k}\mathbf {p} _{k}=-\nabla f(\mathbf {x}_{k}),
\]
!et

where $B_{k}$ is an approximation to the Hessian matrix, which is
updated iteratively at each stage, and $\nabla f(\mathbf {x} _{k})$
is the gradient of the function
evaluated at $x_k$. 
A line search in the direction $p_k$ is then used to
find the next point $x_{k+1}$ by minimising 
!bt
\[
f(\mathbf {x}_{k}+\alpha \mathbf {p}_{k}),
\]
!et
over the scalar $\alpha > 0$.

===== Using gradient descent methods, limitations =====

* _Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function_. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our energy function. If we  deal with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.

* _GD is sensitive to initial conditions_. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.

* _Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate_. In fields like statistics and Machine learning, the function to optimize is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \propto \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \mathbf{w}^T\cdot\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called ``mini batches''. This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.

* GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.

* _GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly._ Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. 
	
* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points.

===== Codes from numerical recipes =====
!bblock
You can however use codes we have adapted from the text "Numerical Recipes in C++":"http://www.nr.com/", see chapter 10.7.  
Here we present a program, which you also can find at the webpage of the course we use the functions _dfpmin_ and _lnsrch_.  This is a variant of the Broyden et al algorithm discussed in the previous slide.

* The program uses the harmonic oscillator in one dimensions as example.
* The program does not use armadillo to handle vectors and matrices, but employs rather my own vector-matrix class. These auxiliary functions, and the main program *model.cpp* can all be found under the "program link here":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics2/tree/gh-pages/doc/pub/cg/programs/c%2B%2B".

Below we show only excerpts from the main program. For the full program, see the above link.

===== Functions to observe =====
!bblock
The functions _Efunction_ and _dEfunction_ compute the expectation value of the energy and its derivative.
They use the the quasi-Newton method of "Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS)":"https://www.springer.com/it/book/9780387303031"
It uses the first derivatives only. The BFGS algorithm has proven good performance even for non-smooth optimizations. 
These functions need to be changed when you want to your own derivatives.
!bc pycod
//  this function defines the expectation value of the local energy
double Efunction(Vector  &x)
{
  double value = x(0)*x(0)*0.5+1.0/(8*x(0)*x(0));
  return value;
} // end of function to evaluate

//  this function defines the derivative of the energy 
void dEfunction(Vector &x, Vector &g)
{
  g(0) = x(0)-1.0/(4*x(0)*x(0)*x(0));
} // end of function to evaluate
!ec
You need to change these functions in order to compute the local energy for your system. I used 1000
cycles per call to get a new value of $\langle E_L[\alpha]\rangle$.
When I compute the local energy I also compute its derivative.
After roughly 10-20 iterations I got a converged result in terms of $\alpha$.
