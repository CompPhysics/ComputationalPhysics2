===== Motivation  ===== 
!bblock
Our aim with this part of the project is to be able to
* find an optimal value for the variational parameters using only some few Monte Carlo cycles
* use these optimal values for the variational parameters to perform a large-scale Monte Carlo calculation

To achieve this will look at methods like *Steepest descent* and the *conjugate gradient method*. Both these methods allow us to find
the minima of a multivariable  function like our energy (function of several variational parameters). 
Alternatively, you can always use Newton's method. In particular, since we will only have one variational parameter,
Newton's method can be easily used in finding the minimum of the local energy.

===== Simple example and demonstration ===== 
!bblock
Let us illustrate what is needed in our calculations using a simple example, the harmonic oscillator in one dimension.
For the harmonic oscillator in one-dimension we have a  trial wave function and probability
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\psi_T(x) = e^{-\alpha^2 x^2} \qquad P_T(x)dx = \frac{e^{-2\alpha^2 x^2}dx}{\int dx e^{-2\alpha^2 x^2}}
\end{equation*}
!et
with $\alpha$ being the variational parameter. 
We obtain then the following local energy
!bt
\begin{equation*}
E_L[\alpha] = \alpha^2+x^2\left(\frac{1}{2}-2\alpha^2\right),
\end{equation*}
!et
which results in the expectation value for the local energy
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle = \frac{1}{2}\alpha^2+\frac{1}{8\alpha^2}
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock



!split
===== Simple example and demonstration ===== 
!bblock
The derivative of the energy with respect to $\alpha$ gives
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha} = \alpha-\frac{1}{4\alpha^3}
\end{equation*}
!et
and a second derivative which is always positive (meaning that we find a minimum)
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha^2} = 1+\frac{3}{4\alpha^4}
\end{equation*}
!et
The condition
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha} = 0,
\end{equation*}
!et
gives the optimal $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$, as expected.

!split
===== Variance in the simple model ===== 
!bblock
We can also minimize the variance. In our simple model the variance is
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\sigma^2[\alpha] = \frac{1}{2}\alpha^4-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{32\alpha^4},
\end{equation*}
!et
with first derivative
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d \sigma^2[\alpha]}{d\alpha} = 2\alpha^3-\frac{1}{8\alpha^5}
\end{equation*}
!et
and a second derivative which is always positive
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2\sigma^2[\alpha]}{d\alpha^2} = 6\alpha^2+\frac{5}{8\alpha^6}
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Computing the derivatives ===== 
!bblock
In general we end up computing the expectation value of the energy in terms 
of some parameters $\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$
and we search for a minimum in this multi-variable parameter space.  
This leads to an energy minimization problem *where we need the derivative of the energy as a function of the variational parameters*.

In the above example this was easy and we were able to find the expression for the derivative by simple derivations. 
However, in our actual calculations the energy is represented by a multi-dimensional integral with several variational parameters.
How can we can then obtain the derivatives of the energy with respect to the variational parameters without having 
to resort to expensive numerical derivations? 

!eblock


!split
===== Expressions for finding the derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock

To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define 
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha}=\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha}.
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha$ (we limit ourselves to one parameter only).
In the above example this was easy and we obtain a simple expression for the derivative.
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}=\frac{d\psi[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha}.
\]
!et  
!eblock



!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are then (using the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha} = 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}E_L[\alpha]\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}\rangle\langle E_L[\alpha] \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}E_L[\alpha]\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}\rangle\langle E_L[\alpha]\rangle
\]
!et
!eblock

===== Exercise: General expression for the derivative of the energy =====

\[

\]

===== Conjugate gradient (CG) method ===== 
!bblock
The success of the CG method  for finding solutions of non-linear problems is based
on the theory of conjugate gradients for linear systems of equations. It belongs
to the class of iterative methods for solving problems from linear algebra of the type
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{A}\hat{x} = \hat{b}.
\end{equation*}
!et
In the iterative process we end up with a problem like

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{r}= \hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x},
\end{equation*}
!et
where $\hat{r}$ is the so-called residual or error in the iterative process.

When we have found the exact solution, $\hat{r}=0$.
!eblock


!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock

The residual is zero when we reach the minimum of the quadratic equation
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  P(\hat{x})=\frac{1}{2}\hat{x}^T\hat{A}\hat{x} - \hat{x}^T\hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
with the constraint that the matrix $\hat{A}$ is positive definite and symmetric.
If we search for a minimum of the quantum mechanical  variance, then the matrix 
$\hat{A}$, which is called the Hessian, is given by the second-derivative of the function we want to minimize.  This quantity is always positive definite.  In our case this corresponds normally to the second derivative of the energy.  
!eblock





!split
===== Conjugate gradient method, Newton's method first ===== 
!bblock
We seek the minimum of the energy or the variance as function of various variational parameters. 
In our case we have thus a function $f$ whose minimum we are seeking.
In Newton's method we set $\nabla f = 0$ and we can thus compute the next iteration point
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}-\hat{x}_i=\hat{A}^{-1}\nabla f(\hat{x}_i).
\end{equation*}
!et
Subtracting this equation from that of $\hat{x}_{i+1}$ we have
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_{i+1}-\hat{x}_i=\hat{A}^{-1}(\nabla f(\hat{x}_{i+1})-\nabla f(\hat{x}_i)).
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Simple example and demonstration ===== 
!bblock
The function $f$ can be either the energy or the variance.  If we choose the energy then we have
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\alpha}_{i+1}-\hat{\alpha}_i=\hat{A}^{-1}(\nabla E(\hat{\alpha}_{i+1})-\nabla E(\hat{\alpha}_i)).
\end{equation*}
!et
In the simple harmonic oscillator model, the gradient and the Hessian $\hat{A}$ are
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha} = \alpha-\frac{1}{4\alpha^3}
\end{equation*}
!et
and a second derivative which is always positive (meaning that we find a minimum)
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{A}= \frac{d^2\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha^2} = 1+\frac{3}{4\alpha^4}
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Simple example and demonstration ===== 
!bblock
We get then
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_{i+1}=\frac{4}{3}\alpha_i-\frac{\alpha_i^4}{3\alpha_{i+1}^3},
\end{equation*}
!et
which can be rewritten as
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_{i+1}^4-\frac{4}{3}\alpha_i\alpha_{i+1}^4+\frac{1}{3}\alpha_i^4.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
In the CG method we define so-called conjugate directions and two vectors 
$\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$
are said to be
conjugate if
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{s}^T\hat{A}\hat{t}= 0.
\end{equation*}
!et
The philosophy of the CG method is to perform searches in various conjugate directions
of our vectors $\hat{x}_i$ obeying the above criterion, namely
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_i^T\hat{A}\hat{x}_j= 0.
\end{equation*}
!et
Two vectors are conjugate if they are orthogonal with respect to 
this inner product. Being conjugate is a symmetric relation: if $\hat{s}$ is conjugate to $\hat{t}$, then $\hat{t}$ is conjugate to $\hat{s}$.
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
An example is given by the eigenvectors of the matrix
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{v}_i^T\hat{A}\hat{v}_j= \lambda\hat{v}_i^T\hat{v}_j,
\end{equation*}
!et
which is zero unless $i=j$. 
!eblock


!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
Assume now that we have a symmetric positive-definite matrix $\hat{A}$ of size
$n\times n$. At each iteration $i+1$ we obtain the conjugate direction of a vector
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_{i+1}=\hat{x}_{i}+\alpha_i\hat{p}_{i}. 
\end{equation*}
!et
We assume that $\hat{p}_{i}$ is a sequence of $n$ mutually conjugate directions. 
Then the $\hat{p}_{i}$  form a basis of $R^n$ and we can expand the solution 
$  \hat{A}\hat{x} = \hat{b}$ in this basis, namely

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{x}  = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i \hat{p}_i.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
The coefficients are given by
!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i \mathbf{A} \mathbf{p}_i = \mathbf{b}.
\end{equation*}
!et
Multiplying with $\hat{p}_k^T$  from the left gives

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{p}_k^T \hat{A}\hat{x} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i\hat{p}_k^T \hat{A}\hat{p}_i= \hat{p}_k^T \hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and we can define the coefficients $\alpha_k$ as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_k = \frac{\hat{p}_k^T \hat{b}}{\hat{p}_k^T \hat{A} \hat{p}_k}
\end{equation*}
!et 
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method and iterations ===== 
!bblock

If we choose the conjugate vectors $\hat{p}_k$ carefully, 
then we may not need all of them to obtain a good approximation to the solution 
$\hat{x}$. 
We want to regard the conjugate gradient method as an iterative method. 
This will us to solve systems where $n$ is so large that the direct 
method would take too much time.

We denote the initial guess for $\hat{x}$ as $\hat{x}_0$. 
We can assume without loss of generality that
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{x}_0=0,
\end{equation*}
!et
or consider the system
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{A}\hat{z} = \hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_0,
\end{equation*}
!et
instead.
!eblock


!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
One can show that the solution $\hat{x}$ is also the unique minimizer of the quadratic form
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  f(\hat{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\hat{x}^T\hat{A}\hat{x} - \hat{x}^T \hat{x} , \quad \hat{x}\in\mathbf{R}^n. 
\end{equation*}
!et
This suggests taking the first basis vector $\hat{p}_1$ 
to be the gradient of $f$ at $\hat{x}=\hat{x}_0$, 
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{A}\hat{x}_0-\hat{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and 
$\hat{x}_0=0$ it is equal $-\hat{b}$.
The other vectors in the basis will be conjugate to the gradient, 
hence the name conjugate gradient method.
!eblock


!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
Let  $\hat{r}_k$ be the residual at the $k$-th step:
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_k=\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_k.
\end{equation*}
!et
Note that $\hat{r}_k$ is the negative gradient of $f$ at 
$\hat{x}=\hat{x}_k$, 
so the gradient descent method would be to move in the direction $\hat{r}_k$. 
Here, we insist that the directions $\hat{p}_k$ are conjugate to each other, 
so we take the direction closest to the gradient $\hat{r}_k$  
under the conjugacy constraint. 
This gives the following expression
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{p}_{k+1}=\hat{r}_k-\frac{\hat{p}_k^T \hat{A}\hat{r}_k}{\hat{p}_k^T\hat{A}\hat{p}_k} \hat{p}_k.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
We can also  compute the residual iteratively as
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_{k+1}=\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_{k+1},
 \end{equation*}
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{b}-\hat{A}(\hat{x}_k+\alpha_k\hat{p}_k),
 \end{equation*}
!et
or
!bt
\begin{equation*}
(\hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{x}_k)-\alpha_k\hat{A}\hat{p}_k,
 \end{equation*}
!et
which gives

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{r}_{k+1}=\hat{r}_k-\hat{A}\hat{p}_{k},
 \end{equation*}
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Using the conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
  * Start your program with calling a function which implements for example the  CG method  or the steepest descent method. 

  * This function needs a function for the expectation value of the local energy and the derivative of the local energy.

  * Your function _func_ is now the Metropolis part with a call to the local energy function. For every call to the function _func_ many practitionser use 1000-10000 Monte Carlo cycles for the trial wave function.

  * This gives an expectation value for the energy which is returned by the function _func_.

  * When one calls the local energy one also computes the first derivative of the expectaction value of the local energy  
!bt 
\begin{equation*} \frac{d\langle E_{L}[\alpha] \rangle}{d\alpha}= 2\langle \frac{\bar{\psi_T}_{\alpha}}{\psi_T[\alpha]}\left(E_L[\alpha]-\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle\right)\rangle.
\end{equation*}
!et
The following two codes, to be found in the "programs folder":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics2/tree/gh-pages/doc/pub/cg/programs/c%2B%2B" as well, implement first the conjugate gradient and steepest descent method to a simple $2\times 2$ problem.

===== Functions to observe =====

These functions need to be changed when you want to your own derivatives.
!bc cppcod
//  this function defines the expectation value of the local energy
double Efunction(Vector  &x)
{
  double value = x(0)*x(0)*0.5+1.0/(8*x(0)*x(0));
  return value;
} // end of function to evaluate

//  this function defines the derivative of the energy 
void dEfunction(Vector &x, Vector &g)
{
  g(0) = x(0)-1.0/(4*x(0)*x(0)*x(0));
} // end of function to evaluate
!ec
You need to change these functions in order to compute the local energy for your system. I used 1000
cycles per call to get a new value of $\langle E_L[\alpha]\rangle$.
When I compute the local energy I also compute its derivative.
After roughly 10-20 iterations I got a converged result in terms of $\alpha$.
