Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   E[H]= \langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle H \rangle .
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====

The trial wave function can be expanded in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian since they form a complete set, viz.,
!bt
\[
   \Psi_T(\bm{R})=\sum_i a_i\Psi_i(\bm{R}),
\]
!et
and assuming the set of eigenfunctions to be normalized one obtains 
!bt
\[
     \frac{\sum_{nm}a^*_ma_n \int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_m(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})}
        {\sum_{nm}a^*_ma_n \int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_m(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})} =\frac{\sum_{n}a^2_n E_n}
        {\sum_{n}a^2_n} \ge E_0,
\]
!et
where we used that $H(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})=E_n\Psi_n(\bm{R})$.
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation
values  are multi-dimensional ones. 
The variational principle yields the lowest state of a given symmetry.

In most cases, a wave function has only small values in large parts of 
configuration space, and a straightforward procedure which uses
homogenously distributed random points in configuration space 
will most likely lead to poor results. This may suggest that some kind
of importance sampling combined with e.g., the Metropolis algorithm 
may be  a more efficient way of obtaining the ground state energy.
The hope is then that those regions of configurations space where
the wave function assumes appreciable values are sampled more 
efficiently.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock
The tedious part in a VMC calculation is the search for the variational
minimum. A good knowledge of the system is required in order to carry out
reasonable VMC calculations. This is not always the case, 
and often VMC calculations 
serve rather as the starting
point for so-called diffusion Monte Carlo calculations (DMC). DMC is a way of
solving exactly the many-body Schroedinger equation by means of 
a stochastic procedure. A good guess on the binding energy
and its wave function is however necessary. 
A carefully performed VMC calculation can aid in this context.

* Construct first a trial wave function $\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})$,  for a many-body system consisting of $N$ particles located at positions 
$\bm{R}=(\bm{R}_1,\dots ,\bm{R}_N)$. The trial wave function depends on $\alpha$ variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\dots ,\alpha_M)$.
* Then we evaluate the expectation value of the hamiltonian $H$ 
!bt
\[
   E[H]=\langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]

* Thereafter we vary $\alpha$ according to some minimization algorithm and return to the first step.

Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.

This is our new probability distribution function  (PDF).
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   E[H(\bm{\alpha})] = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}

called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  E[H(\bm{\alpha})]=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NP(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})E_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})

The Algorithm for performing a variational Monte Carlo calculations runs thus as this
       
  *  Initialisation: Fix the number of Monte Carlo steps. Choose an initial $\bm{R}$ and variational parameters $\alpha$ and calculate $\left|\psi_T^{\alpha}(\bm{R})\right|^2$. 
  *  Initialise the energy and the variance and start the Monte Carlo calculation.
     *  Calculate  a trial position  $\bm{R}_p=\bm{R}+r*step$ where $r$ is a random variable $r \in [0,1]$.
     *  Metropolis algorithm to accept or reject this move  $w = P(\bm{R}_p)/P(\bm{R})$.
     *  If the step is accepted, then we set $\bm{R}=\bm{R}_p$. 
     *  Update averages
  *  Finish and compute final averages.
      
Observe that the jumping in space is governed by the variable *step*. This is Called brute-force sampling.
Need importance sampling to get more relevant sampling, see lectures below.

We note that at $\alpha=1$ we obtain the exact
result, and the variance is zero, as it should. The reason is that 
we then have the exact wave function, and the action of the hamiltionan
on the wave function
!bt
\[
   H\psi = \mathrm{constant}\times \psi,
\]
!et
yields just a constant. The integral which defines various 
expectation values involving moments of the hamiltonian becomes then
!bt
\[
   \langle H^n \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H^n(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}=
\mathrm{constant}\times\frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}=\mathrm{constant}.
\]
!et
_This gives an important information: the exact wave function leads to zero variance!_
Variation is then performed by minimizing both the energy and the variance.

During the development of our code we need to make several checks. It is also very instructive to compute a closed form expression for the local energy. Since our wave function is rather simple  it is straightforward
to find an analytic expressions.  Consider first the case of the simple helium function 
!bt
\[
   \Psi_T(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2) = e^{-\alpha(r_1+r_2)}
\]
!et
The local energy is for this case 
!bt
\[ 
E_{L1} = \left(\alpha-Z\right)\left(\frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}\right)+\frac{1}{r_{12}}-\alpha^2
\]
!et
which gives an expectation value for the local energy given by
!bt
\[
\langle E_{L1} \rangle = \alpha^2-2\alpha\left(Z-\frac{5}{16}\right)
\]
!et
!eblock

===== The first attempt at solving the Helium atom =====

With closed form formulae we  can speed up the computation of the correlation. In our case
we write it as 
!bt
\[
\Psi_C= \exp{\left\{\sum_{i < j}\frac{ar_{ij}}{1+\beta r_{ij}}\right\}},
\]
!et
which means that the gradient needed for the so-called quantum force and local energy 
can be calculated analytically.
This will speed up your code since the computation of the correlation part and the Slater determinant are the most 
time consuming parts in your code.  

We will refer to this correlation function as $\Psi_C$ or the *linear Pade-Jastrow*.
!eblock

!split
===== The first attempt at solving the Helium atom =====
!bblock

We can test this by computing the local energy for our helium wave function
!bt
\[
   \psi_{T}(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2) = 
   \exp{\left(-\alpha(r_1+r_2)\right)}
   \exp{\left(\frac{r_{12}}{2(1+\beta r_{12})}\right)}, 
\]
!et
with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as variational parameters.

The local energy is for this case 
!bt
\[ 
E_{L2} = E_{L1}+\frac{1}{2(1+\beta r_{12})^2}\left\{\frac{\alpha(r_1+r_2)}{r_{12}}(1-\frac{\bm{r}_1\bm{r}_2}{r_1r_2})-\frac{1}{2(1+\beta r_{12})^2}-\frac{2}{r_{12}}+\frac{2\beta}{1+\beta r_{12}}\right\}
\]
!et
It is very useful to test your code against these expressions. It means also that you don't need to
compute a derivative numerically as discussed in the code example below.

For the computation of various derivatives with different types of wave functions, you will find it useful to use python with symbolic python, that is sympy, see "online manual": "http://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html".

!bt
\[

===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The Metropolis algorithm , see "the original article": "http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/21/6/10.1063/1.1699114"  (see also the "FYS3150 lectures": "http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h14/index.html")
was invented by Metropolis et. al
and is often simply called the Metropolis algorithm.
It is a method to sample a normalized probability
distribution by a stochastic process. We define $\mathbf{P}_i^{(n)}$ to
be the probability for finding the system in the state $i$ at step $n$.
The algorithm is then

* Sample a possible new state $j$ with some probability $T_{i\rightarrow j}$.
* Accept the new state $j$ with probability $A_{i \rightarrow j}$ and use it as the next sample. With probability $1-A_{i\rightarrow j}$ the move is rejected and the original state $i$ is used again as a sample.
!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
We wish to derive the required properties of $T$ and $A$ such that
$\mathbf{P}_i^{(n\rightarrow \infty)} \rightarrow p_i$ so that starting
from any distribution, the method converges to the correct distribution.
Note that the description here is for a discrete probability distribution.
Replacing probabilities $p_i$ with expressions like $p(x_i)dx_i$ will
take all of these over to the corresponding continuum expressions.

!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The dynamical equation for $\mathbf{P}_i^{(n)}$ can be written directly from
the description above. The probability of being in the state $i$ at step $n$
is given by the probability of being in any state $j$ at the previous step,
and making an accepted transition to $i$ added to the probability of
being in the state $i$, making a transition to any state $j$ and
rejecting the move:
!bt
\[
\mathbf{P}^{(n)}_i = \sum_j \left [
\mathbf{P}^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
+\mathbf{P}^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}\left ( 1- A_{i\rightarrow j} \right)
\right ] \,.
\]
!et
Since the probability of making some transition must be 1,
$\sum_j T_{i\rightarrow j} = 1$, and the above equation becomes
!bt
\[
\mathbf{P}^{(n)}_i = \mathbf{P}^{(n-1)}_i +
 \sum_j \left [
\mathbf{P}^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
-\mathbf{P}^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] \,.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
For large $n$ we require that $\mathbf{P}^{(n\rightarrow \infty)}_i = p_i$,
the desired probability distribution. Taking this limit, gives the
balance requirement
!bt
\[
 \sum_j \left [
p_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}
-p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] = 0 \,.
\]
!et
The balance requirement is very weak. Typically the much stronger detailed
balance requirement is enforced, that is rather than the sum being
set to zero, we set each term separately to zero and use this
to determine the acceptance probabilities. Rearranging, the result is
!bt
\[
\frac{ A_{j\rightarrow i}}{A_{i\rightarrow j}}
= \frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}} \,.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The Metropolis choice is to maximize the $A$ values, that is
!bt
\[
A_{j \rightarrow i} = \min \left ( 1,
\frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}}\right ).
\]
!et
Other choices are possible, but they all correspond to multilplying
$A_{i\rightarrow j}$ and $A_{j\rightarrow i}$ by the same constant
smaller than unity.\footnote{The penalty function method uses just such
a factor to compensate for $p_i$ that are evaluated stochastically
and are therefore noisy.}
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
Having chosen the acceptance probabilities, we have guaranteed that
if the  $\mathbf{P}_i^{(n)}$ has equilibrated, that is if it is equal to $p_i$,
it will remain equilibrated. Next we need to find the circumstances for
convergence to equilibrium.

The dynamical equation can be written as
!bt
\[
\mathbf{P}^{(n)}_i = \sum_j M_{ij}\mathbf{P}^{(n-1)}_j
\]
!et
with the matrix $M$ given by
!bt
\[
M_{ij} = \delta_{ij}\left [ 1 -\sum_k T_{i\rightarrow k} A_{i \rightarrow k}
\right ] + T_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} \,.
\]
!et
Summing over $i$ shows that $\sum_i M_{ij} = 1$, and since
$\sum_k T_{i\rightarrow k} = 1$, and $A_{i \rightarrow k} \leq 1$, the
elements of the matrix satisfy $M_{ij} \geq 0$. The matrix $M$ is therefore
a stochastic matrix.

!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The Metropolis method is simply the power method for computing the
right eigenvector of $M$ with the largest magnitude eigenvalue.
By construction, the correct probability distribution is a right eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, for the Metropolis method to converge
to this result, we must show that $M$ has only one eigenvalue with this
magnitude, and all other eigenvalues are smaller.

!eblock

===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock 
We need to replace the brute force
Metropolis algorithm with a walk in coordinate space biased by the trial wave function.
This approach is based on the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equation for generating a trajectory in coordinate space.  The link between the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equations are explained, only partly, in the slides below.
An excellent reference on topics like Brownian motion, Markov chains, the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equation is the text by  "Van Kampen": "http://www.elsevier.com/books/stochastic-processes-in-physics-and-chemistry/van-kampen/978-0-444-52965-7"
Here we will focus first on the implementation part first.

For a diffusion process characterized by a time-dependent probability density $P(x,t)$ in one dimension the Fokker-Planck
equation reads (for one particle /walker) 
!bt
\[
   \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x} -F\right)P(x,t),
\]
!et
where $F$ is a drift term and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. 

!eblock


!split
===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock 
The new positions in coordinate space are given as the solutions of the Langevin equation using Euler's method, namely,
we go from the Langevin equation
!bt
\[ 
   \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t} = DF(x(t)) +\eta,
\]
!et
with $\eta$ a random variable,
yielding a new position 
!bt
\[
   y = x+DF(x)\Delta t +\xi\sqrt{\Delta t},
\]
!et
where $\xi$ is gaussian random variable and $\Delta t$ is a chosen time step. 
The quantity $D$ is, in atomic units, equal to $1/2$ and comes from the factor $1/2$ in the kinetic energy operator. Note that $\Delta t$ is to be viewed as a parameter. Values of $\Delta t \in [0.001,0.01]$ yield in general rather stable values of the ground state energy.

The process of isotropic diffusion characterized by a time-dependent probability density $P(\mathbf{x},t)$ obeys (as an approximation) the so-called Fokker-Planck equation 
!bt
\[
   \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \sum_i D\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{x_i}}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{x_i}} -\mathbf{F_i}\right)P(\mathbf{x},t),
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{F_i}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of the drift term (drift velocity) caused by an external potential, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The convergence to a stationary probability density can be obtained by setting the left hand side to zero. The resulting equation will be satisfied if and only if all the terms of the sum are equal zero,
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}^2}} = P\frac{\partial}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}}}\mathbf{F_i} + \mathbf{F_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}}}P.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock 
The drift vector should be of the form $\mathbf{F} = g(\mathbf{x}) \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$. Then,
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}^2}} = P\frac{\partial g}{\partial P}\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i}}  \right)^2 + P g \frac{\partial ^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i^2}}  + g \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i}}  \right)^2.
\]
!et
The condition of stationary density means that the left hand side equals zero. In other words, the terms containing first and second derivatives have to cancel each other. It is possible only if $g = \frac{1}{P}$, which yields

In the Metropolis/Hasting algorithm, the *acceptance ratio* determines the probability for a particle  to be accepted at a new position. The ratio of the trial wave functions evaluated at the new and current positions is given by ($OB$ for the onebody  part)

Here $\Psi_{OB}$ is our onebody part (Slater determinant or product of boson single-particle states)  while $\Psi_{C}$ is our correlation function, or Jastrow factor.

the $\mathbf{\nabla}^2 \Psi_T/\Psi_T$ ratio. The first is needed when we compute the so-called quantum force in importance sampling.
The second is needed when we compute the kinetic energy term of the local energy.

A stochastic process is simply a function of two variables, one is the time,
the other is a stochastic variable $X$, defined by specifying
* the set $\left\{x\right\}$ of possible values for $X$;
* the probability distribution, $w_X(x)$,  over this set, or briefly $w(x)$

The set of values $\left\{x\right\}$ for $X$ 
may be discrete, or continuous. If the set of
values is continuous, then $w_X (x)$ is a probability density so that 
$w_X (x)dx$
is the probability that one finds the stochastic variable $X$ to have values
in the range $[x, x + dx]$ .

The quantity $Y_X (t)$ is called a random function, or, since $t$ often is time,

sample functions.

Consider a particle  suspended in a liquid. On its path through the liquid it will continuously collide with the liquid molecules. Because on average the particle  will collide more often on the front side than on the back side, it will experience a systematic force proportional with its velocity, and directed opposite to its velocity. Besides this systematic force the particle  will experience a stochastic force  $\mathbf{F}(t)$.

The *probability distribution function (PDF)* is a function
$p(x)$ on the domain which, in the discrete case, gives us the
probability or relative frequency with which these values of $X$ occur:
!bt
\[
p(x) = \mathrm{prob}(X=x)
\]
!et
In the continuous case, the PDF does not directly depict the
actual probability. Instead we define the probability for the
stochastic variable to assume any value on an infinitesimal interval
around $x$ to be $p(x)dx$. The continuous function $p(x)$ then gives us
the *density* of the probability rather than the probability
itself. The probability for a stochastic variable to assume any value
on a non-infinitesimal interval $[a,\,b]$ is then just the integral:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{prob}(a\leq X\leq b) = \int_a^b p(x)dx
\]

Qualitatively speaking, a stochastic variable represents the values of
numbers chosen as if by chance from some specified PDF so that the
selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces this PDF.

Also of interest to us is the *cumulative probability distribution function (CDF)*, $P(x)$, which is just the probability

\[
P(x)=\mathrm{Prob(}X\leq x\mathrm{)} =\int_{-\infty}^x p(x^{\prime})dx^{\prime}

A particularly useful class of special expectation values are the
*moments*. The $n$-th moment of the PDF $p$ is defined as
follows:
!bt
\[
\langle x^n\rangle \equiv \int\! x^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th moment $\langle 1\rangle$ is just the normalization condition of
$p$. The first moment, $\langle x\rangle$, is called the *mean* of $p$
and often denoted by the letter $\mu$:
!bt
\[
\langle x\rangle = \mu \equiv \int\! x p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
A special version of the moments is the set of *central moments*,
the n-th central moment defined as:
!bt
\[
\langle (x-\langle x \rangle )^n\rangle \equiv \int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th and first central moments are both trivial, equal $1$ and
$0$, respectively. But the second central moment, known as the
*variance* of $p$, is of particular interest. For the stochastic
variable $X$, the variance is denoted as $\sigma^2_X$ or $\mathrm{var}(X)$:
!bt
\begin{align}
\sigma^2_X\ \ =\ \ \mathrm{var}(X) & =  \langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle =
\int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^2 p(x)\,dx\\
& =  \int\! \left(x^2 - 2 x \langle x\rangle^{2} +
  \langle x\rangle^2\right)p(x)\,dx\\
& =  \langle x^2\rangle - 2 \langle x\rangle\langle x\rangle + \langle x\rangle^2\\
& =  \langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2
\end{align}
!et
The square root of the variance, $\sigma =\sqrt{\langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle}$ is called the *standard deviation* of $p$. It is clearly just the RMS (root-mean-square)
value of the deviation of the PDF from its mean value, interpreted
qualitatively as the *spread* of $p$ around its mean.

Another important quantity is the so called covariance, a variant of
the above defined variance. Consider again the set $\{X_i\}$ of $n$
stochastic variables (not necessarily uncorrelated) with the
multivariate PDF $P(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. The *covariance* of two
of the stochastic variables, $X_i$ and $X_j$, is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &\equiv \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\nonumber\\
&=
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!(x_i-\langle x_i \rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j \rangle)\,
P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
label{eq:def_covariance}
\end{align}
!et
with
!bt
\[
\langle x_i\rangle =
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!x_i\,P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
If we consider the above covariance as a matrix $C_{ij}=\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j)$, then the diagonal elements are just the familiar
variances, $C_{ii} = \mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_i) = \mathrm{var}(X_i)$. It turns out that
all the off-diagonal elements are zero if the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated. This is easy to show, keeping in mind the linearity of
the expectation value. Consider the stochastic variables $X_i$ and
$X_j$, ($i\neq j$):
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &= \langle(x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j - x_i\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle x_j + \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle \\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\langle x_j\rangle\rangle - \langle \langle x_i\rangle x_j\rangle +
\langle \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle +
\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
If $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent, we get 
$\langle x_i x_j\rangle =\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle$, resulting in $\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = 0\ \ (i\neq j)$.

Also useful for us is the covariance of linear combinations of
stochastic variables. Let $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ be two sets of
stochastic variables. Let also $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_i\}$ be two sets of
scalars. Consider the linear combination:
!bt
\[
U = \sum_i a_i X_i \qquad V = \sum_j b_j Y_j
\]
!et
By the linearity of the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(U, V) = \sum_{i,j}a_i b_j \mathrm{cov}(X_i, Y_j)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
Now, since the variance is just $\mathrm{var}(X_i) = \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i)$, we get
the variance of the linear combination $U = \sum_i a_i X_i$:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(U) = \sum_{i,j}a_i a_j \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j)
label{eq:variance_linear_combination}
\end{equation}
!et
And in the special case when the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated, the off-diagonal elements of the covariance are as we
know zero, resulting in:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(U) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{var}(X_i)
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(\sum_i a_i X_i) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{var}(X_i)
\]

they are often associated with results of empirical observation of
some physical or mathematical phenomena; precisely an experiment. We
assume that these values are distributed according to some 
PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$, where $X$ is just the formal symbol for the
stochastic variable whose PDF is $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$. Instead of
trying to determine the full distribution $p$ we are often only

In practical situations a sample is always of finite size. Let that
size be $n$. The expectation value of a sample, the *sample mean*, is then defined as follows:

The *sample variance* is:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar{x}_n)^2
\]

Note that the sample variance is the sample covariance without the
cross terms. In a similar manner as the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:def_covariance}) is a measure of the correlation between
two stochastic variables, the above defined sample covariance is a
measure of the sequential correlation between succeeding measurements
of a sample.

These quantities, being known experimental values, differ
significantly from and must not be confused with the similarly named
quantities for stochastic variables, mean $\mu_X$, variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$
and covariance $\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)$.

The law of large numbers
states that as the size of our sample grows to infinity, the sample
mean approaches the true mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ of the chosen PDF:
!bt
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{x}_n = \mu_X^{\phantom X}
\]
!et
The sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ works therefore as an estimate of the true
mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$.

What we need to find out is how good an approximation $\bar{x}_n$ is to
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$. In any stochastic measurement, an estimated
mean is of no use to us without a measure of its error. A quantity
that tells us how well we can reproduce it in another experiment. We
are therefore interested in the PDF of the sample mean itself. Its
standard deviation will be a measure of the spread of sample means,
and we will simply call it the *error* of the sample mean, or
just sample error, and denote it by $\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$. In
practice, we will only be able to produce an *estimate* of the
sample error since the exact value would require the knowledge of the
true PDFs behind, which we usually do not have.

The straight forward brute force way of estimating the sample error is
simply by producing a number of samples, and treating the mean of each
as a measurement. The standard deviation of these means will then be
an estimate of the original sample error. If we are unable to produce
more than one sample, we can split it up sequentially into smaller
ones, treating each in the same way as above. This procedure is known
as *blocking* and will be given more attention shortly. At this
point it is worth while exploring more indirect methods of estimation
that will help us understand some important underlying principles of
correlational effects.

Let us first take a look at what happens to the sample error as the
size of the sample grows. In a sample, each of the measurements $x_i$
can be associated with its own stochastic variable $X_i$. The
stochastic variable $\overline X_n$ for the sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ is
then just a linear combination, already familiar to us:
!bt
\[
\overline X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\]

It is generally not possible to express $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ in a
closed form given an arbitrary PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}$ and a number
$n$. But for the limit $n\to\infty$ it is possible to make an
approximation. The very important result is called *the central limit theorem*. It tells us that as $n$ goes to infinity,
$p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ approaches a Gaussian distribution whose mean
and variance equal the true mean and variance, $\mu_{X}^{\phantom X}$
and $\sigma_{X}^{2}$, respectively:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{\overline X_n}(x) =
\left(\frac{n}{2\pi\mathrm{var}(X)}\right)^{1/2}
e^{-\frac{n(x-\bar x_n)^2}{2\mathrm{var}(X)}}

The desired variance
$\mathrm{var}(\overline X_n)$, i.e. the sample error squared
$\mathrm{err}_X^2$, is given by:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{err}_X^2 = \mathrm{var}(\overline X_n) = \frac{1}{n^2}
\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j)
label{eq:error_exact}
\end{equation}
!et
We see now that in order to calculate the exact error of the sample
with the above expression, we would need the true means
$\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ of the stochastic variables $X_i$. To
calculate these requires that we know the true multivariate PDF of all
the $X_i$. But this PDF is unknown to us, we have only got the measurements of
one sample. The best we can do is to let the sample itself be an
estimate of the PDF of each of the $X_i$, estimating all properties of
$X_i$ through the measurements of the sample.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
Our estimate of $\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ is then the sample mean $\bar x$
itself, in accordance with the the central limit theorem:
!bt
\[
\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X} = \langle x_i\rangle \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k = \bar x
\]
!et
Using $\bar x$ in place of $\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ we can give an
*estimate* of the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:error_exact})
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\approx\langle (x_i - \bar x)(x_j - \bar{x})\rangle,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[ 
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{l}^n \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k}^n (x_k -\bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)\right)=\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{n} \sum_{kl} (x_k -\bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)=\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
By the same procedure we can use the sample variance as an
estimate of the variance of any of the stochastic variables $X_i$
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(X_i)=\langle x_i - \langle x_i\rangle\rangle \approx \langle x_i - \bar x_n\rangle\nonumber,
\]
!et
which is approximated as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(X_i)\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)=\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:var_estimate_i_think}
\end{equation}
!et

Now we can calculate an estimate of the error
$\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$ of the sample mean $\bar x_n$:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{err}_X^2
&=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) \nonumber \\
&\approx&\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij}\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x) =\frac{1}{n^2}n^2\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate}
\end{align}
!et
which is nothing but the sample covariance divided by the number of
measurements in the sample.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock

In the special case that the measurements of the sample are
uncorrelated (equivalently the stochastic variables $X_i$ are
uncorrelated) we have that the off-diagonal elements of the covariance
are zero. This gives the following estimate of the sample error:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}_X^2=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) =
\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_i \mathrm{var}(X_i),
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{err}_X^2\approx \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_i \mathrm{var}(x)= \frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate_uncorrel}
\end{equation}
!et
where in the second step we have used Eq.~(ref{eq:var_estimate_i_think}).
The error of the sample is then just its standard deviation divided by
the square root of the number of measurements the sample contains.
This is a very useful formula which is easy to compute. It acts as a
first approximation to the error, but in numerical experiments, we
cannot overlook the always present correlations.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
For computational purposes one usually splits up the estimate of
$\mathrm{err}_X^2$, given by Eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate}), into two
parts
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}_X^2 = \frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x) + \frac{1}{n}(\mathrm{cov}(x)-\mathrm{var}(x)),
\]
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)^2 +\frac{2}{n^2}\sum_{k<l} (x_k - \bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)
label{eq:error_estimate_split_up}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term is the same as the error in the uncorrelated case,
Eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_uncorrel}). This means that the second
term accounts for the error correction due to correlation between the
measurements. For uncorrelated measurements this second term is zero.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
Computationally the uncorrelated first term is much easier to treat
efficiently than the second.
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)^2 =
\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2\right) - \bar x_n^2
\]
!et
We just accumulate separately the values $x^2$ and $x$ for every
measurement $x$ we receive. The correlation term, though, has to be
calculated at the end of the experiment since we need all the
measurements to calculate the cross terms. Therefore, all measurements
have to be stored throughout the experiment.
!eblock




!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
Let us analyze the problem by splitting up the correlation term into
partial sums of the form:
!bt
\[
f_d = \frac{1}{n-d}\sum_{k=1}^{n-d}(x_k - \bar x_n)(x_{k+d} - \bar x_n)
\]
!et
The correlation term of the error can now be rewritten in terms of
$f_d$
!bt
\[
\frac{2}{n}\sum_{k<l} (x_k - \bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n) =
2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1} f_d
\]
!et
The value of $f_d$ reflects the correlation between measurements
separated by the distance $d$ in the sample samples.  Notice that for
$d=0$, $f$ is just the sample variance, $\mathrm{var}(x)$. If we divide $f_d$
by $\mathrm{var}(x)$, we arrive at the so called *autocorrelation function*
!bt
\[
\kappa_d = \frac{f_d}{\mathrm{var}(x)}
\]
!et
which gives us a useful measure of the correlation pair correlation
starting always at $1$ for $d=0$.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
The sample error (see eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_split_up})) can now be
written in terms of the autocorrelation function:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{err}_X^2 &=
\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)+\frac{2}{n}\cdot\mathrm{var}(x)\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}
\frac{f_d}{\mathrm{var}(x)}\nonumber\\ &=&
\left(1+2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}\kappa_d\right)\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)\nonumber\\
&=\frac{\tau}{n}\cdot\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate_corr_time}
\end{align}
!et
and we see that $\mathrm{err}_X$ can be expressed in terms the
uncorrelated sample variance times a correction factor $\tau$ which
accounts for the correlation between measurements. We call this
correction factor the *autocorrelation time*:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\tau = 1+2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}\kappa_d
label{eq:autocorrelation_time}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
For a correlation free experiment, $\tau$
equals 1. From the point of view of
eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_corr_time}) we can interpret a sequential
correlation as an effective reduction of the number of measurements by
a factor $\tau$. The effective number of measurements becomes:
!bt
\[
n_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{n}{\tau}
\]
!et
To neglect the autocorrelation time $\tau$ will always cause our
simple uncorrelated estimate of $\mathrm{err}_X^2\approx \mathrm{var}(x)/n$ to
be less than the true sample error. The estimate of the error will be
too *good*. On the other hand, the calculation of the full
autocorrelation time poses an efficiency problem if the set of
measurements is very large.

===== Can we understand this? Time Auto-correlation Function =====
!bblock
The so-called time-displacement autocorrelation $\phi(t)$ for a quantity $\mathbf{M}$ is given by
!bt
\[
\phi(t) = \int dt' \left[\mathbf{M}(t')-\langle \mathbf{M} \rangle\right]\left[\mathbf{M}(t'+t)-\langle \mathbf{M} \rangle\right],
\]
!et
which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
\phi(t) = \int dt' \left[\mathbf{M}(t')\mathbf{M}(t'+t)-\langle \mathbf{M} \rangle^2\right],
\]
!et
where $\langle \mathbf{M} \rangle$ is the average value and
$\mathbf{M}(t)$ its instantaneous value. We can discretize this function as follows, where we used our
set of computed values $\mathbf{M}(t)$ for a set of discretized times (our Monte Carlo cycles corresponding to moving all electrons?)
!bt
\[
\phi(t)  = \frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\sum_{t'=0}^{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\mathbf{M}(t')\mathbf{M}(t'+t)
-\frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\sum_{t'=0}^{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\mathbf{M}(t')\times
\frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\sum_{t'=0}^{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\mathbf{M}(t'+t).
label{eq:phitf}
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Time Auto-correlation Function =====
!bblock
One should be careful with times close to $t_{\mathrm{max}}$, the upper limit of the sums 
becomes small and we end up integrating over a rather small time interval. This means that the statistical
error in $\phi(t)$ due to the random nature of the fluctuations in $\mathbf{M}(t)$ can become large.

One should therefore choose $t \ll t_{\mathrm{max}}$.

Note that the variable $\mathbf{M}$ can be any expectation values of interest.



The time-correlation function gives a measure of the correlation between the various values of the variable 
at a time $t'$ and a time $t'+t$. If we multiply the values of $\mathbf{M}$ at these two different times,
we will get a positive contribution if they are fluctuating in the same direction, or a negative value
if they fluctuate in the opposite direction. If we then integrate over time, or use the discretized version of, the time correlation function $\phi(t)$ should take a non-zero value if the fluctuations are 
correlated, else it should gradually go to zero. For times a long way apart 
the different values of $\mathbf{M}$  are most likely 
uncorrelated and $\phi(t)$ should be zero.

===== Time Auto-correlation Function =====

We can derive the correlation time by observing that our Metropolis algorithm is based on a random
walk in the space of all  possible spin configurations. 
Our probability 
distribution function $\mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)$ after a given number of time steps $t$ could be written as
!bt
\[
   \mathbf{\hat{w}}(t) = \mathbf{\hat{W}^t\hat{w}}(0),
\]
!et
with $\mathbf{\hat{w}}(0)$ the distribution at $t=0$ and $\mathbf{\hat{W}}$ representing the 
transition probability matrix. 
We can always expand $\mathbf{\hat{w}}(0)$ in terms of the right eigenvectors of 
$\mathbf{\hat{v}}$ of $\mathbf{\hat{W}}$ as 
!bt
\[
    \mathbf{\hat{w}}(0)  = \sum_i\alpha_i\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i,
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
   \mathbf{\hat{w}}(t) = \mathbf{\hat{W}}^t\mathbf{\hat{w}}(0)=\mathbf{\hat{W}}^t\sum_i\alpha_i\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i=
\sum_i\lambda_i^t\alpha_i\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i,
\]
!et
with $\lambda_i$ the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ eigenvalue corresponding to  
the eigenvector $\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i$. 
!eblock




!split
===== Time Auto-correlation Function =====
!bblock
If we assume that $\lambda_0$ is the largest eigenvector we see that in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$,
$\mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)$ becomes proportional to the corresponding eigenvector 
$\mathbf{\hat{v}}_0$. This is our steady state or final distribution. 

We can relate this property to an observable like the mean energy.
With the probabilty $\mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)$ (which in our case is the squared trial wave function) we
can write the expectation values as 
!bt
\[
 \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle  = \sum_{\mu} \mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)_{\mu}\mathbf{M}_{\mu},
\] 
!et 
or as the scalar of a  vector product
!bt
 \[
 \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle  = \mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)\mathbf{m},

!et 
with $\mathbf{m}$ being the vector whose elements are the values of $\mathbf{M}_{\mu}$ in its 
various microstates $\mu$.

 \[
 \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle  = \mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)\mathbf{m}=\sum_i\lambda_i^t\alpha_i\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i\mathbf{m}_i.
\] 
!et 
If we define $m_i=\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i\mathbf{m}_i$ as the expectation value of
$\mathbf{M}$ in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ eigenstate we can rewrite the last equation as
!bt
 \[
 \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle  = \sum_i\lambda_i^t\alpha_im_i.
\] 
!et
Since we have that in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ the mean value is dominated by the 
the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$, we can rewrite the last equation as
!bt
 \[
 \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle  = \langle \mathbf{M}(\infty) \rangle+\sum_{i\ne 0}\lambda_i^t\alpha_im_i.
\] 
!et
We define the quantity
!bt
\[
   \tau_i=-\frac{1}{log\lambda_i},
\]
!et
and rewrite the last expectation value as
!bt
 \[
 \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle  = \langle \mathbf{M}(\infty) \rangle+\sum_{i\ne 0}\alpha_im_ie^{-t/\tau_i}.

===== Time Auto-correlation Function =====

The quantities $\tau_i$ are the correlation times for the system. They control also the auto-correlation function 
discussed above.  The longest correlation time is obviously given by the second largest
eigenvalue $\tau_1$, which normally defines the correlation time discussed above. For large times, this is the 
only correlation time that survives. If higher eigenvalues of the transition matrix are well separated from 
$\lambda_1$ and we simulate long enough,  $\tau_1$ may well define the correlation time. 
In other cases we may not be able to extract a reliable result for $\tau_1$. 
Coming back to the time correlation function $\phi(t)$ we can present a more general definition in terms
of the mean magnetizations $ \langle \mathbf{M}(t) \rangle$. Recalling that the mean value is equal 
to $ \langle \mathbf{M}(\infty) \rangle$ we arrive at the expectation values
!bt
\[
\phi(t) =\langle \mathbf{M}(0)-\mathbf{M}(\infty)\rangle \langle \mathbf{M}(t)-\mathbf{M}(\infty)\rangle,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[
\phi(t) =\sum_{i,j\ne 0}m_i\alpha_im_j\alpha_je^{-t/\tau_i},

We have to differentiate the determinant with respect to
all spatial coordinates of all particles. A brute force
differentiation would involve $N\cdot d$ evaluations of the entire
determinant which would even worsen the already undesirable time

Consider the ratio, which we shall call $R$, between $\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\vert$ and $\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\vert$. 
By definition, each of these determinants can

Suppose now that we move only one particle  at a time, meaning that
$\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}$ differs from $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}$ by the
position of only one, say the *i*-th, particle . This means that $\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})$ and $\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})$ differ
only by the entries of the *i*-th row.  Recall also that the *i*-th row
of a cofactor matrix $\hat{C}$ is independent of the entries of the
*i*-th row of its corresponding matrix $\hat{D}$. In this particular
case we therefore get that the *i*-th row of $\hat{C}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})$ 
and $\hat{C}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})$ must be
equal. Explicitly, we have:
!bt
\begin{equation}
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}) = C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\quad
\forall\ j\in\{1,\dots,N\}

Inserting this into the numerator of eq.~(ref{eq:detratio_cofactors})
and using eq.~(ref{eq:inverse_cofactor}) to substitute the cofactors
with the elements of the inverse matrix, we get:
!bt
\begin{equation}
R =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})}
{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\,
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})} =
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})}

Now by eq.~(ref{eq:unity_explicitely}) the denominator of the rightmost
expression must be unity, so that we finally arrive at:
!bt
\begin{equation}
R =
\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}) = 
\sum_{j=1}^N \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})
label{eq:detratio_inverse}
\end{equation}
!et
What this means is that in order to get the ratio when only the *i*-th
particle  has been moved, we only need to calculate the dot
product of the vector $\left(\phi_1(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new}),\,\dots,\,\phi_N(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new})\right)$ of single particle  wave functions
evaluated at this new position with the *i*-th column of the inverse
matrix $\hat{D}^{-1}$ evaluated at the original position. Such
an operation has a time scaling of $O(N)$. The only extra thing we
need to do is to maintain the inverse matrix $\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{old}})$.

!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
If the new position $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}$ is accepted, then the
inverse matrix can by suitably updated by an algorithm having a time
scaling of $O(N^2)$.  This algorithm goes as
follows. First we update all but the *i*-th column of $\hat{D}^{-1}$. For each column $j\neq i$, we first calculate the quantity:
!bt
\begin{equation}
S_j =
(\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\times
\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}))_{ij} =
\sum_{l=1}^N d_{il}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d^{-1}_{lj}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})
label{eq:inverse_update_1}
\end{equation}
!et


!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
The new elements of the *j*-th column of $\hat{D}^{-1}$ are then given
by:
!bt
\begin{equation}
d_{kj}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}) =
d_{kj}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}) -
\frac{S_j}{R}\,d_{ki}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\quad
\begin{array}{ll}
\forall\ \ k\in\{1,\dots,N\}\\j\neq i
\end{array}
label{eq:inverse_update_2}
\end{equation}
!et

!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock

Finally the elements of the *i*-th column of $\hat{D}^{-1}$ are updated
simply as follows:
!bt
\begin{equation}
d_{ki}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}) =
\frac{1}{R}\,d_{ki}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\quad
\forall\ \ k\in\{1,\dots,N\}
label{eq:inverse_update_3}
\end{equation}
!et
We see from these formulas that the time scaling of an update of
$\hat{D}^{-1}$ after changing one row of $\hat{D}$ is $O(N^2)$.


The scheme is also applicable for the calculation of the ratios
involving derivatives. It turns
out that differentiating the Slater determinant with respect
to the coordinates of a single particle  $\mathbf{r}_i$ changes only the
*i*-th row of the corresponding Slater matrix.

===== The gradient and the Laplacian =====

The gradient and the Laplacian can therefore be calculated as follows:
!bt
\[
\frac{\vec\nabla_i\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert}{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \vec\nabla_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \vec\nabla_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r})
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\nabla^2_i\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert}{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \nabla^2_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \nabla^2_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)\,d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r})
\]
!et

!split
===== How to compute the derivates of the Slater determinant =====
!bblock

Thus, to calculate all the derivatives of the Slater determinant, we
only need the derivatives of the single particle  wave functions
($\vec\nabla_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)$ and $\nabla^2_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)$)
and the elements of the corresponding inverse Slater matrix ($\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}_i)$). A calculation of a single derivative is by the
above result an $O(N)$ operation. Since there are $d\cdot N$
derivatives, the time scaling of the total evaluation becomes
$O(d\cdot N^2)$. With an $O(N^2)$ updating algorithm for the
inverse matrix, the total scaling is no worse, which is far better
than the brute force approach yielding $O(d\cdot N^4)$.

_Important note_: In most cases you end with closed form expressions for the single-particle  wave functions. It is then useful to calculate the various derivatives and make separate functions
for them.

\left| \begin{array}{cccc} \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)& \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)&\psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_4) \\

\]
!et
The Slater determinant as written is zero since the spatial wave functions for the spin up and spin down 
states are equal.  
But we can rewrite it as the product of two Slater determinants, one for spin up and one for spin down.

\[
\det\uparrow(1,2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left| \begin{array}{cc} \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)\\
\psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2) \end{array} \right|,

\]
!et
The total determinant is still zero!

!eblock

===== Splitting the Slater determinant =====
!bblock

We want to avoid to sum over spin variables, in particular when the interaction does not depend on spin.

It can be shown, see for example Moskowitz and Kalos, "Int.~J.~Quantum Chem. _20_ 1107 (1981)": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qua.560200508/abstract", that for the variational energy
we can approximate the Slater determinant as  
!bt
\[
   \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,,\mathbf{r}_3,\mathbf{r}_4, \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) \propto \det\uparrow(1,2)\det\downarrow(3,4),
\]
!et
or more generally as 
!bt
\[
   \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\dots \mathbf{r}_N) \propto \det\uparrow \det\downarrow,
\]
!et
where we have the Slater determinant as the product of a spin up part involving the number of electrons with spin up only (2 for beryllium and 5 for neon) and a spin down part involving the electrons with spin down.

This ansatz is not antisymmetric under the exchange of electrons with  opposite spins but it can be shown (show this) that it gives the same
expectation value for the energy as the full Slater determinant.

As long as the Hamiltonian is spin independent, the above is correct. It is rather straightforward to see this if you go back to the equations for the energy discussed earlier  this semester.

!eblock

!split
===== Spin up and spin down parts =====
!bblock

We will thus
factorize the full determinant $\vert\hat{D}\vert$ into two smaller ones, where 
each can be identified with $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$
respectively:
!bt
\[
\vert\hat{D}\vert = \vert\hat{D}\vert_\uparrow\cdot \vert\hat{D}\vert_\downarrow
\]
!et

!eblock

!split
===== Factorization =====
!bblock
The combined dimensionality of the two smaller determinants equals the
dimensionality of the full determinant. Such a factorization is
advantageous in that it makes it possible to perform the calculation
of the ratio $R$ and the updating of the inverse matrix separately for
$\vert\hat{D}\vert_\uparrow$ and $\vert\hat{D}\vert_\downarrow$:
!bt
\[
\frac{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{new}}{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{old}} =
\frac{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{new}_\uparrow}
{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{old}_\uparrow}\cdot
\frac{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{new}_\downarrow
}{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{old}_\downarrow}
\]
!et


This reduces the calculation time by a constant factor. The maximal
time reduction happens in a system of equal numbers of $\uparrow$ and
$\downarrow$ particles, so that the two factorized determinants are
half the size of the original one.


!eblock

!split
===== Number of operations =====
!bblock
Consider the case of moving only one particle  at a time which
originally had the following time scaling for one transition:
!bt
\[
O_R(N)+O_\mathrm{inverse}(N^2)
\]
!et
For the factorized determinants one of the two determinants is
obviously unaffected by the change so that it cancels from the ratio
$R$. 


!eblock

!split
===== Counting the number of FLOPS =====
!bblock
Therefore, only one determinant of size $N/2$ is involved in each
calculation of $R$ and update of the inverse matrix. The scaling of
each transition then becomes:
!bt
\[
O_R(N/2)+O_\mathrm{inverse}(N^2/4)
\]
!et
and the time scaling when the transitions for all $N$ particles are
put together:
!bt
\[
O_R(N^2/2)+O_\mathrm{inverse}(N^3/4)
\]
!et
which gives the same reduction as in the case of moving all particles
at once.
!eblock

!split
===== Computation of ratios =====
!bblock

Computing the ratios discussed above requires that we maintain 
the inverse of the Slater matrix evaluated at the current position. 
Each time a trial position is accepted, the row number $i$ of the Slater 
matrix changes and updating its inverse has to be carried out. 
Getting the inverse of an $N \times N$ matrix by Gaussian elimination has a 
complexity of order of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ operations, a luxury that we 
cannot afford for each time a particle  move is accepted.
We will use the expression
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{updatingInverse}
d^{-1}_{kj}(\mathbf{x^{new}}) = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
  d^{-1}_{kj}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) - \frac{d^{-1}_{ki}(\mathbf{x^{old}})}{R} \sum_{l=1}^{N} d_{il}(\mathbf{x^{new}})  d^{-1}_{lj}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) & \mbox{if $j \neq i$}\nonumber \\ \\
 \frac{d^{-1}_{ki}(\mathbf{x^{old}})}{R} \sum_{l=1}^{N} d_{il}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) d^{-1}_{lj}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) & \mbox{if $j=i$}
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
!et

===== Scaling properties =====
!bblock
This equation scales as $O(N^2)$.
The evaluation of the determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix by standard Gaussian elimination 
requires $\mathbf{O}(N^3)$
calculations. 
As there are $Nd$ independent coordinates we need to evaluate $Nd$ Slater determinants 
for the gradient (quantum force) and $Nd$ for the Laplacian (kinetic energy). 
With the updating algorithm we need only to invert the Slater 
determinant matrix once. This can be done by standard LU decomposition methods.


!eblock

!split
===== How to get the determinant =====
!bblock
Determining a determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix by
standard Gaussian elimination is of the order of $\mathbf{O}(N^3)$
calculations. As there are $N\cdot d$ independent coordinates we need
to evaluate $Nd$ Slater determinants for the gradient (quantum force) and
$N\cdot d$ for the Laplacian (kinetic energy)

With the updating algorithm we need only to invert the Slater determinant matrix once.
This is done by calling standard LU decomposition methods.


If you choose to implement the above recipe for the computation of the Slater determinant,
you need to LU decompose the Slater matrix. This is described in chapter 6 of the lecture notes 
from FYS3150.

You need to call the function ludcmp in lib.cpp.
You need to transfer the Slater matrix and its dimension. You get back an LU decomposed matrix.

!bt
\[
R =\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}) = 
\sum_{j=1}^N \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})
\]
!et
What this means is that in order to get the ratio when only the *i*-th
particle  has been moved, we only need to calculate the dot
product of the vector $\left(\phi_1(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new}),\,\dots,\,
\phi_N(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new})\right)$ of single particle  wave functions
evaluated at this new position with the *i*-th column of the inverse
matrix $\hat{D}^{-1}$ evaluated at the original position. Such
an operation has a time scaling of $O(N)$. The only extra thing we
need to do is to maintain the inverse matrix 
$\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{old}})$.

===== Problems with spherical harmonics =====

A problem with the spherical harmonics is that they are complex. The introduction of *solid harmonics* allows the use
of real orbital wave-functions for a wide range of applications. The
complex solid harmonics $\mathbf{Y}_{lm_l}(\mathbf{r})$ are related to
the spherical harmonics  $Y_{lm_l}(\mathbf{r})$ through
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{Y}_{lm_l}(\mathbf{r}) = r^l Y_{lm_l}(\mathbf{r}).
\end{equation*}
!et
By factoring out the leading $r$-dependency of the radial-function
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{R}_{nl}(\mathbf{r}) = r^{-l} R_{nl}(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation*}
!et
we obtain 
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta, \phi) %=R_{nl}(r) \cdot Y_{lm_l}(\theta,\phi)
  = \mathbf{R}_{nl}(\mathbf{r})\cdot\mathbf{Y}_{lm_l}(\mathbf{r}).

the unitary transformation

\begin{equation*}
  \left( \begin{split} &\phantom{i} S_{lm_l} \\ 
    &S_{l,-m_l} \end{split} \right)

This transformation will not alter any physical quantities that are
degenerate in the subspace consisting of opposite magnetic quantum
numbers (the angular momentum $l$ is equal for both these cases). This
means for example that the above transformation does not alter the
energies, unless an external magnetic field is applied to the
system. Henceforth, we will use the solid harmonics, and note that
changing the spherical potential beyond the Coulomb potential will not
alter the solid harmonics.
