An operator is defined as $\hat{O}$ throughout. Unless otherwise specified the number of particles is
always $N$ and $d$ is the dimension of the system.  In nuclear physics
we normally define the total number of particles to be $A=N+Z$, where
$N$ is total number of neutrons and $Z$ the total number of
protons. In case of other baryons such isobars $\Delta$ or various
hyperons such as $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$, one needs to add their
definitions.  Hereafter, $N$ is reserved for the total number of
particles, unless otherwise specificied.

The quantum numbers of a single-particle state in coordinate space are
defined by the variable 
!bt
\[
x=({\bf r},\sigma), 
\]
!et
where 
!bt
\[
{\bf r}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d},
\]
!et
with $d=1,2,3$ represents the spatial coordinates and $\sigma$ is the eigenspin of the particle. For fermions with eigenspin $1/2$ this means that
!bt
\[
 x\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d}\oplus (\frac{1}{2}),
\]
!et
and the integral $\int dx = \sum_{\sigma}\int d^dr = \sum_{\sigma}\int d{\bf r}$,
and
!bt
\[
\int d^Nx= \int dx_1\int dx_2\dots\int dx_N.

The quantum mechanical wave function of a given state with quantum numbers $\lambda$ (encompassing all quantum numbers needed to specify the system), ignoring time, is
!bt
\[
\Psi_{\lambda}=\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
with $x_i=({\bf r}_i,\sigma_i)$ and the projection of $\sigma_i$ takes the values
$\{-1/2,+1/2\}$ for particles with spin $1/2$. 
We will hereafter always refer to $\Psi_{\lambda}$ as the exact wave function, and if the ground state is not degenerate we label it as 
!bt
\[
\Psi_0=\Psi_0(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N).
\]
!et
!eblock

===== Definitions =====

Since the solution $\Psi_{\lambda}$ seldomly can be found in closed form, approximations are sought. Here we define an approximative wave function or an ansatz to the exact wave function as 
!bt
\[
\Phi_{\lambda}=\Phi_{\lambda}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
with
!bt 
\[
\Phi_0=\Phi_0(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),

being the ansatz to the ground state.

The wave function $\Psi_{\lambda}$ is sought in the Hilbert space of either symmetric or anti-symmetric $N$-body functions, namely
!bt
\[
\Psi_{\lambda}\in {\cal H}_N:= {\cal H}_1\oplus{\cal H}_1\oplus\dots\oplus{\cal H}_1,
\]
!et
where the single-particle Hilbert space $\hat{H}_1$ is the space of square integrable functions over
$\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d}\oplus (\sigma)$
resulting in

\[
{\cal H}_1:= L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d}\oplus (\sigma)).

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
\]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

The Schrodinger equation reads 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N) \Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N) = 
E_\lambda  \Psi_\lambda(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N), label{eq:basicSE1}
\end{equation}
!et
where the vector $x_i$ represents the coordinates (spatial and spin) of particle $i$, $\lambda$ stands  for all the quantum
numbers needed to classify a given $N$-particle state and $\Psi_{\lambda}$ is the pertaining eigenfunction.  Throughout this course,
$\Psi$ refers to the exact eigenfunction, unless otherwise stated.

We write the Hamilton operator, or Hamiltonian,  in a generic way 
!bt
\[
	\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V} 
\]
!et
where $\hat{T}$  represents the kinetic energy of the system
!bt
\[
	\hat{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m_i} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i} \mathbf{\nabla_i}^2 \right) =
		\sum_{i=1}^N t(x_i)
\]
!et
while the operator $\hat{V}$ for the potential energy is given by
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) + \sum_{ji=1}^N v(x_i,x_j)+\sum_{ijk=1}^Nv(x_i,x_j,x_k)+\dots
label{eq:firstv}
\end{equation}
!et
Hereafter we use natural units, viz.~$\hbar=c=e=1$, with $e$ the elementary charge and $c$ the speed of light. This means that momenta and masses
have dimension energy.

If one does quantum chemistry, after having introduced the  Born-Oppenheimer approximation which effectively freezes out the nucleonic degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian for $N=n_e$ electrons takes the following form 
!bt 
\[
  \hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} t(x_i) - \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} k\frac{Z}{r_i} + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e} \frac{k}{r_{ij}},
\]
!et
with $k=1.44$ eVnm
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We can rewrite this as
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e}\hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e}\frac{1}{r_{ij}},
label{H1H2}
\end{equation}
!et
where  we have defined 
!bt
\[
r_{ij}=| {\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|,
\]
!et
 and
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) - \frac{Z}{x_i}.
label{hi}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term of Eq.~(ref{H1H2}), $H_0$, is the sum of the $N$
*one-body* Hamiltonians $\hat{h}_0$. Each individual
Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_0$ contains the kinetic energy operator of an
electron and its potential energy due to the attraction of the
nucleus. The second term, $H_I$, is the sum of the $n_e(n_e-1)/2$
two-body interactions between each pair of electrons. Note that the double sum carries a restriction $i < j$.
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The potential energy term due to the attraction of the nucleus defines the onebody field $u_i=u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ of Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
We have moved this term into the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the Hamiltonian, instead of keeping  it in $\hat{V}$ as in  Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
The reason is that we will hereafter treat $\hat{H}_0$ as our non-interacting  Hamiltonian. For a many-body wavefunction $\Phi_{\lambda}$ defined by an  
appropriate single-particle basis, we may solve exactly the non-interacting eigenvalue problem 
!bt 
\[
\hat{H}_0\Phi_{\lambda}= w_{\lambda}\Phi_{\lambda},
\]
!et
with $w_{\lambda}$ being the non-interacting energy. This energy is defined by the sum over single-particle energies to be defined below.
For atoms the single-particle energies could be the hydrogen-like single-particle energies corrected for the charge $Z$. For nuclei and quantum
dots, these energies could be given by the harmonic oscillator in three and two dimensions, respectively.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^N V(r_{ij}),
label{Hnuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
with 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations.

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles. % (exercise here, prove it)
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt 
\[

$\hat{P}$ as well, that is

\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

In our case we assume that  we can approximate the exact eigenfunction with a Slater determinant
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \Phi(x_1, x_2,\dots ,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)& \psi_{\alpha}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\alpha}(x_N)\\
                            \psi_{\beta}(x_1)&\psi_{\beta}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\beta}(x_N)\\

\end{equation}

where  $x_i$  stand for the coordinates and spin values of a particle $i$ and $\alpha,\beta,\dots, \gamma$ 
are quantum numbers needed to describe remaining quantum numbers.

The single-particle function $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$  are eigenfunctions of the onebody
Hamiltonian $h_i$, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i)=\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i),
\]
!et
with eigenvalues 
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i) \psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right)\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i).
\]
!et
The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies. 
The total energy is in this case the sum over all  single-particle energies, if no two-body or more complicated
many-body interactions are present.

Let us denote the ground state energy by $E_0$. According to the
variational principle we have
!bt
\[
  E_0 \le E[\Phi] = \int \Phi^*\hat{H}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
where $\Phi$ is a trial function which we assume to be normalized
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} = 1,
\]
!et
where we have used the shorthand $d\mathbf{\tau}=d\mathbf{r}_1d\mathbf{r}_2\dots d\mathbf{r}_N$.
!eblock

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
In the Hartree-Fock method the trial function is the Slater
determinant of Eq.~(ref{eq:HartreeFockDet}) which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
  \Phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_{P} (-)^P\hat{P}\psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N)=\sqrt{N!}\hat{A}\Phi_H,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the antisymmetrization operator $\hat{A}$ defined by the 
summation over all possible permutations of two particles.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
It is defined as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A} = \frac{1}{N!}\sum_{p} (-)^p\hat{P},
label{antiSymmetryOperator}
\end{equation}
!et
with $p$ standing for the number of permutations. We have introduced for later use the so-called
Hartree-function, defined by the simple product of all possible single-particle functions
!bt
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =
  \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N).
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Both $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{H}_I$ are invariant under all possible permutations of any two particles
and hence commute with $\hat{A}$
!bt
\begin{equation}
  [H_0,\hat{A}] = [H_I,\hat{A}] = 0. label{commutionAntiSym}
\end{equation}
!et
Furthermore, $\hat{A}$ satisfies
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}^2 = \hat{A},  label{AntiSymSquared}
\end{equation}
!et
since every permutation of the Slater
determinant reproduces it.

The expectation value of $\hat{H}_0$ 
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
is readily reduced to
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
where we have used Eqs.~(ref{commutionAntiSym}) and
(ref{AntiSymSquared}). The next step is to replace the antisymmetrization
operator by its definition and to
replace $\hat{H}_0$ with the sum of one-body operators
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The integral vanishes if two or more particles are permuted in only one
of the Hartree-functions $\Phi_H$ because the individual single-particle wave functions are
orthogonal. We obtain then
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}= \sum_{i=1}^N \int \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\Phi_H  d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
Orthogonality of the single-particle functions allows us to further simplify the integral, and we
arrive at the following expression for the expectation values of the
sum of one-body Hamiltonians 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \int \psi_{\mu}^*(\mathbf{r})\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})
  d\mathbf{r}.
  label{H1Expectation}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We introduce the following shorthand for the above integral
!bt
\[
\langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(\mathbf{r})\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(\mathbf{r}),
\]
!et
and rewrite Eq.~(ref{H1Expectation}) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle.
  label{H1Expectation1}

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The expectation value of the two-body part of the Hamiltonian is obtained in a
similar manner. We have
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_I\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
which reduces to
!bt
\[
 \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i\le j=1}^N \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*V(r_{ij})\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
by following the same arguments as for the one-body
Hamiltonian. 
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Because of the dependence on the inter-particle distance $r_{ij}$,  permutations of
any two particles no longer vanish, and we get
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i < j=1}^N \int  
  \Phi_H^*V(r_{ij})(1-P_{ij})\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
where $P_{ij}$ is the permutation operator that interchanges
particle $i$ and particle $j$. Again we use the assumption that the single-particle wave functions
are orthogonal. 
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We obtain
!bt
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}

The first term is the so-called direct term. It is frequently also called the  Hartree term, 
while the second is due to the Pauli principle and is called
the exchange term or just the Fock term.
The factor  $1/2$ is introduced because we now run over
all pairs twice.
