===== Basics of the Metropolis Algorithm =====


The Metropolis et al.
algorithm was invented by Metropolis et. a
and is often simply called the Metropolis algorithm.
It is a method to sample a normalized probability
distribution by a stochastic process. We define ${\cal P}_i^{(n)}$ to
be the probability for finding the system in the state $i$ at step $n$.
The algorithm is then

!split
=====  The basic of the Metropolis Algorithm =====

* Sample a possible new state $j$ with some probability $T_{i\rightarrow j}$.
* Accept the new state $j$ with probability $A_{i \rightarrow j}$ and use it as the next sample.
* With probability $1-A_{i\rightarrow j}$ the move is rejected and the original state $i$ is used again as a sample.


We wish to derive the required properties of $T$ and $A$ such that
${\cal P}_i^{(n\rightarrow \infty)} \rightarrow p_i$ so that starting
from any distribution, the method converges to the correct distribution.
Note that the description here is for a discrete probability distribution.
Replacing probabilities $p_i$ with expressions like $p(x_i)dx_i$ will
take all of these over to the corresponding continuum expressions.

!split
===== More on the Metropolis =====

The dynamical equation for ${\cal P}_i^{(n)}$ can be written directly from
the description above. The probability of being in the state $i$ at step $n$
is given by the probability of being in any state $j$ at the previous step,
and making an accepted transition to $i$ added to the probability of
being in the state $i$, making a transition to any state $j$ and
rejecting the move:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq1}
{\cal P}^{(n)}_i = \sum_j \left [
{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
+{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}\left ( 1- A_{i\rightarrow j} \right)
\right ] \,.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
=====  Metropolis algorithm, setting it up =====
Since the probability of making some transition must be 1,
$\sum_j T_{i\rightarrow j} = 1$, and Eq. (ref{eq:eq1}) becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
{\cal P}^{(n)}_i = {\cal P}^{(n-1)}_i +
 \sum_j \left [
{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
-{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] \,.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Metropolis continues =====

For large $n$ we require that ${\cal P}^{(n\rightarrow \infty)}_i = p_i$,
the desired probability distribution. Taking this limit, gives the
balance requirement

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_j \left [p_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}-p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] = 0,
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Detailed Balance =====

The balance requirement is very weak. Typically the much stronger detailed
balance requirement is enforced, that is rather than the sum being
set to zero, we set each term separately to zero and use this
to determine the acceptance probabilities. Rearranging, the result is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{ A_{j\rightarrow i}}{A_{i\rightarrow j}}
= \frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}} \,.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== More on Detailed Balance =====

The Metropolis choice is to maximize the $A$ values, that is

!bt
\begin{equation}
A_{j \rightarrow i} = \min \left ( 1,
\frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}}\right ).
\end{equation}
!et

Other choices are possible, but they all correspond to multilplying
$A_{i\rightarrow j}$ and $A_{j\rightarrow i}$ by the same constant
smaller than unity. The penalty function method uses just such
a factor to compensate for $p_i$ that are evaluated stochastically
and are therefore noisy.

Having chosen the acceptance probabilities, we have guaranteed that
if the  ${\cal P}_i^{(n)}$ has equilibrated, that is if it is equal to $p_i$,
it will remain equilibrated. Next we need to find the circumstances for
convergence to equilibrium.

!split
===== Dynamical Equation =====

The dynamical equation can be written as

!bt
\begin{equation}
{\cal P}^{(n)}_i = \sum_j M_{ij}{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_j
\end{equation}
!et
with the matrix $M$ given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
M_{ij} = \delta_{ij}\left [ 1 -\sum_k T_{i\rightarrow k} A_{i \rightarrow k}
\right ] + T_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} \,.
\end{equation}
!et

Summing over $i$ shows that $\sum_i M_{ij} = 1$, and since
$\sum_k T_{i\rightarrow k} = 1$, and $A_{i \rightarrow k} \leq 1$, the
elements of the matrix satisfy $M_{ij} \geq 0$. The matrix $M$ is therefore
a stochastic matrix.


!split
===== Interpreting the Metropolis Algorithm =====

The Metropolis method is simply the power method for computing the
right eigenvector of $M$ with the largest magnitude eigenvalue.
By construction, the correct probability distribution is a right eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, for the Metropolis method to converge
to this result, we must show that $M$ has only one eigenvalue with this
magnitude, and all other eigenvalues are smaller.

Even a defective matrix has at least one left and right eigenvector for
each eigenvalue. An example of a defective matrix is


!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
with two zero eigenvalues, only one right eigenvector

!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
and only one left eigenvector $(0\ 1)$.

!split
===== Gershgorin bounds and Metropolis =====

The Gershgorin bounds for the eigenvalues can be derived by multiplying on
the left with the eigenvector with the maximum and minimum eigenvalues,

!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_i \psi^{\rm max}_i M_{ij} =& \lambda_{\rm max}  \psi^{\rm max}_j
\nonumber\\
\sum_i \psi^{\rm min}_i M_{ij} =& \lambda_{\rm min}  \psi^{\rm min}_j
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Normalizing the Eigenvectors =====

Next we choose the normalization of these eigenvectors so that the
largest element (or one of the equally largest elements)
has value 1. Let's call this element $k$, and
we can therefore bound the magnitude of the other elements to be less
than or equal to 1.
This leads to the inequalities, using the property that $M_{ij}\geq 0$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_i M_{ik} \leq \lambda_{\rm max}
\nonumber\\
M_{kk}-\sum_{i \neq k} M_{ik} \geq \lambda_{\rm min}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
where the equality from the maximum
will occur only if the eigenvector takes the value 1 for all values of
$i$ where $M_{ik} \neq 0$, and the equality for the minimum will
occur only if the eigenvector takes the value -1 for all values of $i\neq k$
where $M_{ik} \neq 0$.


!split
===== More Metropolis analysis =====

That the maximum eigenvalue is 1 follows immediately from the property
that $\sum_i M_{ik} = 1$. Similarly the minimum eigenvalue can be -1,
but only if $M_{kk} = 0$ and the magnitude of all the other elements
$\psi_i^{\rm min}$ of
the eigenvector that multiply nonzero elements $M_{ik}$ are -1.

Let's first see what the properties of $M$ must be
to eliminate any -1 eigenvalues. 
To have a -1 eigenvalue, the left eigenvector must contain only $\pm 1$
and $0$ values. Taking in turn each $\pm 1$ value as the maximum, so that
it corresponds to the index $k$, the nonzero $M_{ik}$ values must
correspond to $i$ index values of the eigenvector which have opposite
sign elements. That is, the $M$ matrix must break up into sets of
states that always make transitions from set A to set B ... back to set A.
In particular, there can be no rejections of these moves in the cycle
since the -1 eigenvalue requires $M_{kk}=0$. To guarantee no eigenvalues
with eigenvalue -1, we simply have to make sure that there are no
cycles among states. Notice that this is generally trivial since such
cycles cannot have any rejections at any stage. An example of such
a cycle is sampling a noninteracting Ising spin. If the transition is
taken to flip the spin, and the energy difference is zero, the Boltzmann
factor will not change and the move will always be accepted. The system
will simply flip from up to down to up to down ad infinitum. Including
a rejection probability or using a heat bath algorithm
immediately fixes the problem.

!split
===== Final Considerations I =====

Next we need to make sure that there is only one left eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1. To get an eigenvalue 1, the left eigenvector must be 
constructed from only ones and zeroes. It is straightforward to
see that a vector made up of
ones and zeroes can only be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 if the 
matrix element $M_{ij} = 0$ for all cases where $\psi_i \neq \psi_j$.
That is we can choose an index $i$ and take $\psi_i = 1$.
We require all elements $\psi_j$ where $M_{ij} \neq 0$ to also have
the value $1$. Continuing we then require all elements $\psi_\ell$ $M_{j\ell}$
to have value $1$. Only if the matrix $M$ can be put into block diagonal
form can there be more than one choice for the left eigenvector with
eigenvalue 1. We therefore require that the transition matrix not
be in block diagonal form. This simply means that we must choose
the transition probability so that we can get from any allowed state
to any other in a series of transitions.

!split
===== Final Considerations II =====


Finally, we note that for a defective matrix, with more eigenvalues
than independent eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1,
the left and right
eigenvectors of eigenvalue 1 would be orthogonal.
Here the left eigenvector is all 1
except for states that can never be reached, and the right eigenvector
is $p_i > 0$ except for states that give zero probability. We already
require that we can reach
all states that contribute to $p_i$. Therefore the left and right
eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1 do not correspond to a defective sector
of the matrix and they are unique. The Metropolis algorithm therefore
converges exponentially to the desired distribution.


!split
===== Final Considerations III =====

The requirements for the transition $T_{i \rightarrow j}$ are
* A series of transitions must let us to get from any allowed state to any other by a finite series of transitions.
* The transitions cannot be grouped into sets of states, A, B, C ,... such that transitions from $A$ go to $B$, $B$ to $C$ etc and finally back to $A$. With condition (a) satisfied, this condition will always be satisfied if either $T_{i \rightarrow i} \neq 0$ or there are some rejected moves.

===== Importance Sampling: Overview of what needs to be coded =====

!bblock

For a diffusion process characterized by a time-dependent probability density $P(x,t)$ in one dimension the Fokker-Planck
equation reads (for one particle /walker) 
!bt
\[
   \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x} -F\right)P(x,t),
\]
!et
where $F$ is a drift term and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. 

!eblock


!split
===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock 
The new positions in coordinate space are given as the solutions of the Langevin equation using Euler's method, namely,
we go from the Langevin equation
!bt
\[ 
   \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t} = DF(x(t)) +\eta,
\]
!et
with $\eta$ a random variable,
yielding a new position 
!bt
\[
   y = x+DF(x)\Delta t +\xi\sqrt{\Delta t},
\]
!et
where $\xi$ is gaussian random variable and $\Delta t$ is a chosen time step. 
The quantity $D$ is, in atomic units, equal to $1/2$ and comes from the factor $1/2$ in the kinetic energy operator. Note that $\Delta t$ is to be viewed as a parameter. Values of $\Delta t \in [0.001,0.01]$ yield in general rather stable values of the ground state energy.

===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock 
The process of isotropic diffusion characterized by a time-dependent probability density $P(\mathbf{x},t)$ obeys (as an approximation) the so-called Fokker-Planck equation 
!bt
\[
   \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \sum_i D\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{x_i}}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{x_i}} -\mathbf{F_i}\right)P(\mathbf{x},t),
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{F_i}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of the drift term (drift velocity) caused by an external potential, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The convergence to a stationary probability density can be obtained by setting the left hand side to zero. The resulting equation will be satisfied if and only if all the terms of the sum are equal zero,
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}^2}} = P\frac{\partial}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}}}\mathbf{F_i} + \mathbf{F_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}}}P.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock 
The drift vector should be of the form $\mathbf{F} = g(\mathbf{x}) \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$. Then,
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}^2}} = P\frac{\partial g}{\partial P}\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i}}  \right)^2 + P g \frac{\partial ^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i^2}}  + g \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i}}  \right)^2.
\]
!et
The condition of stationary density means that the left hand side equals zero. In other words, the terms containing first and second derivatives have to cancel each other. It is possible only if $g = \frac{1}{P}$, which yields
!bt
\[
\mathbf{F} = 2\frac{1}{\Psi_T}\nabla\Psi_T,
\]
!et
which is known as the so-called *quantum force*. This term is responsible for pushing the walker towards regions of configuration space where the trial wave function is large, increasing the efficiency of the simulation in contrast to the Metropolis algorithm where the walker has the same probability of moving in every direction.

===== Importance sampling =====
!bblock
The Fokker-Planck equation yields a (the solution to the equation) transition probability given by the Green's function
!bt
\[
  G(y,x,\Delta t) = \frac{1}{(4\pi D\Delta t)^{3N/2}} \exp{\left(-(y-x-D\Delta t F(x))^2/4D\Delta t\right)}
\]
!et
which in turn means that our brute force Metropolis algorithm
!bt
\[ 
    A(y,x) = \mathrm{min}(1,q(y,x))),
\]
!et
with $q(y,x) = |\Psi_T(y)|^2/|\Psi_T(x)|^2$ is now replaced by the "Metropolis-Hastings algorithm":"http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/21/6/10.1063/1.1699114" as well as "Hasting's article":"http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/1/97.abstract", 
!bt
\[
q(y,x) = \frac{G(x,y,\Delta t)|\Psi_T(y)|^2}{G(y,x,\Delta t)|\Psi_T(x)|^2}
\]
!et
