===== Overview of week 17, April 26-30 =====
!bblock  
* We have three project groups based on the selection below
  o Time-dependent Hartree-Fock with "material":"https://github.com/Schoyen/tdhf-project-fys4411/tree/master"
  o Neural Networks and Boltzmann Machines with "material":"http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics2/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/boltzmannmachines.html"
  o Quantum Machine Learning with "material":"http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics2/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/basicquantumcomputing.html"
!eblock

!bblock  Schedule
The groups meet each Thursday at 2.15pm for theory lectures and discussions till approx 4pm. The remaining three hours are dedicated to project work. We meet first in plenum and then go different breakout rooms. The group teachers and discussion partners  are
o Group 1 TDHF: Ã˜yvind
o Group 2 NN+Boltzmann machines: Morten
o Group 3 Quantum Machine Learning: Kristian Wold and Stian Bilek

===== Alternatives for project 2 =====
!bblock
o Fermion VMC, continuation of project 1
o Deep learning applied to project 1, either neural networks or Boltzmann machines
o Hartree-Fock theory and time-dependent theories
o Many-body methods like coupled-cluster theory or other many-body methods
o Quantum computing and possibly quantum machine learning
o Suggestions from you
