 The spectacular demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in gases of
 alkali atoms $^{87}$Rb, $^{23}$Na, $^7$Li confined in magnetic
 traps has led to an explosion of interest in
 confined Bose systems. Of interest is the fraction of condensed atoms, the
 nature of the condensate, the excitations above the condensate, the atomic
 density in the trap as a function of Temperature and the critical temperature of BEC,
 $T_c$. 

 A key feature of the trapped alkali and atomic hydrogen systems is that they are
 dilute. The characteristic dimensions of a typical trap for $^{87}$Rb is
 $a_{h0}=\left( {\hbar}/{m\omega_\perp}\right)^\frac{1}{2}=1-2 \times 10^4$
 \AA\ . The interaction between $^{87}$Rb atoms can be well represented
 by its s-wave scattering length, $a_{Rb}$. This scattering length lies in the
 range $85 < a_{Rb} < 140 a_0$ where $a_0 = 0.5292$ \AA\ is the Bohr radius.
 The definite value $a_{Rb} = 100 a_0$ is usually selected and
 for calculations the definite ratio of atom size to trap size 
 $a_{Rb}/a_{h0} = 4.33 \times 10^{-3}$ 
 is usually chosen. A typical $^{87}$Rb atom
 density in the trap is $n \simeq 10^{12}- 10^{14}$ atoms per cubic cm, giving an
 inter-atom spacing $\ell \simeq 10^4$ \AA. Thus the effective atom size is small
 compared to both the trap size and the inter-atom spacing, the condition
 for diluteness ($na^3_{Rb} \simeq 10^{-6}$ where $n = N/V$ is the number
 density). 

Many theoretical studies of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in gases
of alkali atoms confined in magnetic or optical traps have been
conducted in the framework of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation.  The
key point for the validity of this description is the dilute condition
of these systems, that is, the average distance between the atoms is
much larger than the range of the inter-atomic interaction. In this
situation the physics is dominated by two-body collisions, well
described in terms of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$.  The crucial
parameter defining the condition for diluteness is the gas parameter
$x(\mathbf{r})= n(\mathbf{r}) a^3$, where $n(\mathbf{r})$ is the local density
of the system. For low values of the average gas parameter $x_{av}\le 10^{-3}$, the mean field Gross-Pitaevskii equation does an excellent
job.  However,
in recent experiments, the local gas parameter may well exceed this
value due to the possibility of tuning the scattering length in the
presence of a so-called Feshbach resonance.
