===== Why Hartree-Fock?  =====
!bblock
Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is an algorithm for finding an approximative expression for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The basic ingredients are
 *  Define a single-particle basis $\{\psi_{\alpha}\}$ so that
!bt
\[ 
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}\psi_{\alpha} = \varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}
\]
!et
with the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian defined as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}=\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}
\]
!et
 *  The term  $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ is a single-particle potential to be determined by the HF algorithm.
 *  The HF algorithm means to choose $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ in order to have 
!bt
\[ \langle \hat{H} \rangle = E^{\mathrm{HF}}= \langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_0 \rangle
\]
!et
that is to find a local minimum with a Slater determinant $\Phi_0$ being the ansatz for the ground state. 
 *  The variational principle ensures that $E^{\mathrm{HF}} \ge E_0$, with $E_0$ the exact ground state energy.

===== Why Hartree-Fock?  =====
!bblock
We will show that the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian $\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ equals our definition of the operator $\hat{f}$ discussed in connection with the new definition of the normal-ordered Hamiltonian (see later lectures), that is we have, for a specific matrix element
!bt
\[
\langle p |\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}| q \rangle =\langle p |\hat{f}| q \rangle=\langle p|\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}|q \rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS},
\]
!et
meaning that
!bt
\[
\langle p|\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}|q\rangle = \sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The so-called Hartree-Fock potential $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ brings an explicit medium dependence due to the summation over all single-particle states below the Fermi level $F$. It brings also in an explicit dependence on the two-body interaction (in nuclear physics we can also have complicated three- or higher-body forces). The two-body interaction, with its contribution from the other bystanding fermions, creates an effective mean field in which a given fermion moves, in addition to the external potential $\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ which confines the motion of the fermion. For systems like nuclei, there is no external confining potential. Nuclei are examples of self-bound systems, where the binding arises due to the intrinsic nature of the strong force. For nuclear systems thus, there would be no external one-body potential in the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian.

===== Definitions ===== 
!bblock
An operator is defined as $\hat{O}$ throughout. Unless otherwise specified the number of particles is
always $N$ and $d$ is the dimension of the system.  In nuclear physics
we normally define the total number of particles to be $A=N+Z$, where
$N$ is total number of neutrons and $Z$ the total number of
protons. In case of other baryons such isobars $\Delta$ or various
hyperons such as $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$, one needs to add their
definitions.  Hereafter, $N$ is reserved for the total number of
particles, unless otherwise specificied.

We will hereafter always refer to $\Psi_{\lambda}$ as the exact wave function, and if the ground state is not degenerate we label it as

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
\]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

We write the Hamilton operator, or Hamiltonian,  in a generic way

If one does quantum chemistry, after having introduced the  Born-Oppenheimer approximation which effectively freezes out the nucleonic degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian for $N=n_e$ electrons takes the following form 
!bt 
\[
  \hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} t(x_i) - \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} k\frac{Z}{r_i} + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e} \frac{k}{r_{ij}},
\]
!et
with $k=1.44$ eVnm
!eblock

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We can rewrite this as
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e}\hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e}\frac{1}{r_{ij}},
label{H1H2}
\end{equation}
!et
where  we have defined 
!bt
\[
r_{ij}=| {\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|,
\]
!et
 and
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) - \frac{Z}{x_i}.
label{hi}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term of Eq.~(ref{H1H2}), $H_0$, is the sum of the $N$
*one-body* Hamiltonians $\hat{h}_0$. Each individual
Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_0$ contains the kinetic energy operator of an
electron and its potential energy due to the attraction of the
nucleus. The second term, $H_I$, is the sum of the $n_e(n_e-1)/2$
two-body interactions between each pair of electrons. Note that the double sum carries a restriction $i < j$.

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The potential energy term due to the attraction of the nucleus defines the onebody field $u_i=u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ of Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
We have moved this term into the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the Hamiltonian, instead of keeping  it in $\hat{V}$ as in  Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
The reason is that we will hereafter treat $\hat{H}_0$ as our non-interacting  Hamiltonian. For a many-body wavefunction $\Phi_{\lambda}$ defined by an  
appropriate single-particle basis, we may solve exactly the non-interacting eigenvalue problem 
!bt 
\[
\hat{H}_0\Phi_{\lambda}= w_{\lambda}\Phi_{\lambda},
\]
!et
with $w_{\lambda}$ being the non-interacting energy. This energy is defined by the sum over single-particle energies to be defined below.
For atoms the single-particle energies could be the hydrogen-like single-particle energies corrected for the charge $Z$. For nuclei and quantum
dots, these energies could be given by the harmonic oscillator in three and two dimensions, respectively.

===== Definitions and notations =====

We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^N V(r_{ij}),

!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations.

Since we will deal with Fermions (identical and indistinguishable particles) we will

by a chosen basis of single-particle functions. 

For a given $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ we can write its determinant

and the sum runs over all $n!$ permutations.  The quantity $p_i$ represents the number of transpositions of column indices that are needed in order to bring a given permutation back to its initial ordering, in our case given by $a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn}$ here.

with $p$ standing for the number of permutations. We have introduced for later use the so-called
Hartree-function, defined by the simple product of all possible single-particle functions
!bt
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =

is readily reduced to

\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}

(ref{AntiSymSquared}). The next step is to replace the antisymmetrization
operator by its definition and to
replace $\hat{H}_0$ with the sum of one-body operators
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}

The integral vanishes if two or more particles are permuted in only one
of the Hartree-functions $\Phi_H$ because the individual single-particle wave functions are

\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}

===== Reminder on Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
The calculus of variations involves 
problems where the quantity to be minimized or maximized is an integral. 

In the general case we have an integral of the type
!bt
\[ 
E[\Phi]= \int_a^b f(\Phi(x),\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x},x)dx,
\]
!et
where $E$ is the quantity which is sought minimized or maximized.
The problem is that although $f$ is a function of the variables $\Phi$, $\partial \Phi/\partial x$ and $x$, the exact dependence of
$\Phi$ on $x$ is not known.  This means again that even though the integral has fixed limits $a$ and $b$, the path of integration is
not known. In our case the unknown quantities are the single-particle wave functions and we wish to choose an integration path which makes
the functional $E[\Phi]$ stationary. This means that we want to find minima, or maxima or saddle points. In physics we search normally for minima.
Our task is therefore to find the minimum of $E[\Phi]$ so that its variation $\delta E$ is zero  subject to specific
constraints. In our case the constraints appear as the integral which expresses the orthogonality of the  single-particle wave functions.
The constraints can be treated via the technique of Lagrangian multipliers
!eblock


!split
===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers, simple example  =====
!bblock 
Let us specialize to the expectation value of the energy for one particle in three-dimensions.
This expectation value reads
!bt
\[
  E=\int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \hat{H} \psi(x,y,z),
\]
!et
with the constraint
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \psi(x,y,z)=1,
\]
!et
and a Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
\hat{H}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V(x,y,z).
\]
!et
We will, for the sake of notational convenience,  skip the variables $x,y,z$ below, and write for example $V(x,y,z)=V$.
!eblock

!split
===== Manipulating terms  =====
!bblock 
The integral involving the kinetic energy can be written as, with the function $\psi$ vanishing
strongly for large values of $x,y,z$ (given here by the limits $a$ and $b$), 
!bt
 \[
  \int_a^b dxdydz \psi^* \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\right) \psi dxdydz = \psi^*\nabla\psi|_a^b+\int_a^b dxdydz\frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi.
\]
!et
We will drop the limits $a$ and $b$ in the remaining discussion. 
Inserting this expression into the expectation value for the energy and taking the variational minimum  we obtain
!bt
\[
\delta E = \delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et

===== Adding the Lagrangian multiplier  =====
!bblock 
The constraint appears in integral form as 
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^* \psi=\mathrm{constant},
\]
!et
and multiplying with a Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ and taking the variational minimum we obtain the final variational equation
!bt
\[
\delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
We introduce the function  $f$
!bt
\[
  f =  \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi=
\frac{1}{2}(\psi^*_x\psi_x+\psi^*_y\psi_y+\psi^*_z\psi_z)+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi,
\]
!et
where we have skipped the dependence on $x,y,z$ and introduced the shorthand $\psi_x$, $\psi_y$ and $\psi_z$  for the various derivatives.
!eblock

!split
===== And with the Euler-Lagrange equations we get  =====
!bblock 
For $\psi^*$ the Euler-Lagrange  equations yield
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*}- \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_x}-\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_y}-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_z}=0,
\] 
!et
which results in 
!bt
\[
    -\frac{1}{2}(\psi_{xx}+\psi_{yy}+\psi_{zz})+V\psi=\lambda \psi.
\]
!et
We can then identify the  Lagrangian multiplier as the energy of the system. The last equation is 
nothing but the standard 
Schroedinger equation and the variational  approach discussed here provides 
a powerful method for obtaining approximate solutions of the wave function.

===== Hartree-Fock by varying the coefficients of a wave function expansion =====
!bblock
In deriving the Hartree-Fock equations, we  will expand the single-particle functions in a known basis  and vary the coefficients, 
that is, the new single-particle wave function is written as a linear expansion
in terms of a fixed chosen orthogonal basis (for example the well-known harmonic oscillator functions or the hydrogen-like functions etc).
We define our new Hartree-Fock single-particle basis by performing a unitary transformation 
on our previous basis (labelled with greek indices) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\psi_p^{HF}  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\phi_{\lambda}. label{eq:newbasis}
\end{equation}
!et
In this case we vary the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$. If the basis has infinitely many solutions, we need
to truncate the above sum.  We assume that the basis $\phi_{\lambda}$ is orthogonal. A unitary transformation keeps the orthogonality, as discussed in exercise 1 below.  
!eblock

!split
===== More on linear algebra  =====
!bblock
In the previous slide we stated that a unitary transformation keeps the orthogonality, as discussed in exercise 1 below.  To see this consider first a basis of vectors $\mathbf{v}_i$,
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_i = \begin{bmatrix} v_{i1} \\ \dots \\ \dots \\v_{in} \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
We assume that the basis is orthogonal, that is 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et
An orthogonal or unitary transformation
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_i=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i,
\]
!et
preserves the dot product and orthogonality since
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_j^T\mathbf{w}_i=(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_j)^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i=\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i= \mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et
!eblock
!split
=====  Coefficients of a wave function expansion =====
!bblock
This means that if the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$ belong to a unitary or orthogonal trasformation (using the Dirac bra-ket notation)
!bt
\[
\vert p\rangle  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\vert\lambda\rangle,
\]
!et
orthogonality is preserved, that is $\langle \alpha \vert \beta\rangle = \delta_{\alpha\beta}$
and $\langle p \vert q\rangle = \delta_{pq}$. 

This propertry is extremely useful when we build up a basis of many-body Stater determinant based states. 

_Note also that although a basis $\vert \alpha\rangle$ contains an infinity of states, for practical calculations we have always to make some truncations._

where $det(\mathbf{C})$ and $det(\mathbf{B})$ are the determinants of $n\times n$ matrices
with elements $c_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ respectively.

To set up the algorithm we can proceed as follows:

 * We start with a guess $C_{i\alpha}^{(0)}=\delta_{i,\alpha}$. Alternatively, we could have used random starting values as long as the vectors are normalized. Another possibility is to give states below the Fermi level a larger weight.
 * The Hartree-Fock matrix simplifies then to (assuming that the coefficients $C_{i\alpha} $  are real)

These two equations can thus be used to the electron affinity or ionization energies, respectively. 
Koopman's theorem states that for example the ionization energy of a closed-shell system is given by the energy of the highest occupied single-particle state.  If we assume that changing the number of electrons from $N$ to $N+1$ does not change the Hartree-Fock single-particle energies and eigenfunctions, then Koopman's theorem simply states that the ionization energy of an atom is given by the single-particle energy of the last bound state. In a similar way, we can also define the electron affinities.

As an example, consider a simple model for atomic sodium, Na. Neutral sodium has eleven electrons, 
with the weakest bound one being confined the $3s$ single-particle quantum numbers. The energy needed to remove an electron from neutral sodium is rather small, 5.1391 eV, a feature which pertains to all alkali metals.
Having performed a  Hartree-Fock calculation for neutral sodium would then allows us to compute the
ionization energy by using the single-particle energy for the $3s$ states, namely $\epsilon_{3s}^{\mathrm{HF}}$. 

From these considerations, we see that Hartree-Fock theory allows us to make a connection between experimental 
observables (here ionization and affinity energies) and the underlying interactions between particles.  
In this sense, we are now linking the dynamics and structure of a many-body system with the laws of motion which govern the system. Our approach is a reductionistic one, meaning that we want to understand the laws of motion 
in terms of the particles or degrees of freedom which we believe are the fundamental ones. Our Slater determinant, being constructed as the product of various single-particle functions, follows this philosophy.

===== Exercise: Matrix elements for the Hartree-Fock method and the nuclear shell model  =====

We will assume that we can build various Slater determinants using an orthogonal  single-particle basis $\psi_{\lambda}$, 
with $\lambda = 1,2,\dots,A$. 


The aim of this exercise is to set up specific matrix elements that will turn useful when we start our discussions of the nuclear shell model. In particular you will notice, depending on the character of the operator, that many matrix elements will actually be zero.

Consider three $A$-particle  Slater determinants  $|\Phi_0$, $|\Phi_i^a\rangle$ and $|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$, where the notation means that 
Slater determinant $|\Phi_i^a\rangle$ differs from $|\Phi_0\rangle$ by one single-particle state, that is a single-particle
state $\psi_i$ is replaced by a single-particle state $\psi_a$. 
It will later be interpreted as a so-called one-particle-one-hole excitation.
Similarly, the Slater determinant $|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$
differs by two single-particle states from $|\Phi_0\rangle$ and is normally thought of as a two-particle-two-hole excitation.

Define a general onebody operator $\hat{F} = \sum_{i}^A\hat{f}(x_{i})$ and a general  twobody operator $\hat{G}=\sum_{i>j}^A\hat{g}(x_{i},x_{j})$ with $g$ being invariant under the interchange of the coordinates of particles $i$ and $j$. You can use here the results from the second exercise set, exercise 3.

The equations are often rewritten in terms of a so-called density matrix,
which is defined as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
