!split
===== Energy models =====

Last week we defined a domain $\bm{X}$ of stochastic variables $\bm{X}= \{x_0,x_1, \dots , x_{n-1}\}$ with a pertinent probability distribution
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X})=\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}p(x_i),
\]
!et
where we have assumed that the random varaibles $x_i$ are all independent and identically distributed (iid).

We will now assume that we can defined this function in terms of optimization parameters $\bm{\Theta}$, which could be the biases and weights of deep network, and a set of hidden variables we also assume to be random variables which also are iid. The domain of these variables is
$\bm{H}= \{h_0,h_1, \dots , h_{m-1}\}$.

!split
===== Probability model =====

We define a probability
!bt
\[
p(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
where $f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})$ is a function which we assume is larger or
equal than zero and obeys all properties required for a probability
distribution and $Z(\bm{\Theta})$ is a normalization constant. Inspired by
statistical mechanics, we call it often for the partition function.
It is defined as (assuming that we have discrete probability distributions)
!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Marginal and conditional probabilities =====

We can in turn define the marginal probabilities
!bt
\[
p(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
p(h_i;\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Change of notation =====

_Note the change to a vector notation_. A variable like $\bm{x}$
represents now a specific _configuration_. We can generate an infinity
of such configurations. The final partition function is then the sum
over all such possible configurations, that is

!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
changes to
!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{\bm{x}}\sum_{\bm{h}} f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}).
\]
!et
If we have a binary set of variable $x_i$ and $h_j$ and $M$ values of $x_i$ and $N$ values of $h_j$ we have in total $2^M$ and $2^N$ possible $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$ configurations, respectively.

We see that even for the modest binary case, we can easily approach a
number of configuration which is not possible to deal with.

!split
===== Optimization problem =====

At the end, we are not interested in the probabilities of the hidden variables. The probability we thus want to optimize is 
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})=\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}p(x_i;\bm{\Theta})=\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\left(\frac{\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}\right),
\]
!et
which we rewrite as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\left(\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})\right).
\]
!et

!split
===== Further simplifications =====

We simplify further by rewriting it as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i;\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
where we used $p(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})$.
The optimization problem is then
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \mathrm{arg} \hspace{0.1cm}\max_{\bm{\bm{\Theta}}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}} \hspace{0.1cm}p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Optimizing the logarithm instead =====

Computing the derivatives with respect to the parameters $\bm{\Theta}$ is
easier (and equivalent) if we compute  the logarithm of the
probability. We will thus optimize
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \mathrm{arg} \hspace{0.1cm}\max_{\bm{\bm{\Theta}}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}} \hspace{0.1cm}\log{p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
which leads to
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})}=0.
\]
!et

!split
===== Expression for the gradients =====
This leads to the following equation
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})}=\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\left(\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}\right)-\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=0.
\]
!et

The first term is called the positive phase and we assume that we have a model for the function $f$ from which we can sample values. Below we will develop an explicit model for this.
The second term is called the negative phase and is the one which leads to more difficulties.

!split
===== The derivative of the partition function =====

The partition function, defined above as
!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
is in general the most problematic term. In principle both $x$ and $h$ can span large degrees of freedom, if not even infinitely many ones, and computing the partition function itself is often not desirable or even feasible. The above derivative of the partition function can however be written in terms of an expectation value which is in turn evaluated  using Monte Carlo sampling and the theory of Markov chains, popularly shortened to MCMC (or just MC$^2$).

!split
===== Explicit expression for the derivative =====
We can rewrite
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}Z(\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
which reads in more detail
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}} \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})   }{Z(\bm{\Theta})}.
\]
!et

We can rewrite the function $f$ (we have assumed that is larger or
equal than zero) as $f=\exp{\log{f}}$. We can then reqrite the last
equation as

!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{ \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}} \nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\exp{\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}}   }{Z(\bm{\Theta})}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Final expression =====

Taking the derivative gives us
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{ \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) \nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}   }{Z(\bm{\Theta})}, 
\]
!et
which is the expectation value of $\log{f}$
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}p(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) \nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
that is
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\mathbb{E}(\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}).
\]
!et

This quantity is evaluated using Monte Carlo sampling, with Gibbs
sampling as the standard sampling rule.  Before we discuss the
explicit algorithms, we need to remind ourselves about Markov chains
and sampling rules like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Gibbs
sampling.

!split
===== Introducing the energy model =====

As we will see below, a typical Boltzmann machines employs a probability distribution
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
where $f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$ is given by a so-called energy model. If we assume that the random variables $x_i$ and $h_j$ take binary values only, for example $x_i,h_j=\{0,1\}$, we have a so-called binary-binary model where
!bt
\[
f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})=-E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}} x_i a_i+\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} b_j h_j + \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X},h_j\in\bm{H}} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\]
!et
where the set of parameters are given by the biases and weights $\bm{\Theta}=\{\bm{a},\bm{b},\bm{W}\}$.
_Note the vector notation_ instead of $x_i$ and $h_j$ for $f$. The vectors $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$ represent a specific instance of stochastic variables $x_i$ and $h_j$. These arrangements of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$ lead to a specific energy configuration.

!split
===== More compact notation =====

With the above definition we can write the probability as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{\exp{(\bm{a}^T\bm{x}+\bm{b}^T\bm{h}+\bm{x}^T\bm{W}\bm{h})}}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
where the biases $\bm{a}$ and $\bm{h}$ and the weights defined by the matrix $\bm{W}$ are the parameters we need to optimize.

!split
===== Anticipating results to be derived =====

Since the binary-binary energy model is linear in the parameters $a_i$, $b_j$ and
$w_{ij}$, it is easy to see that the derivatives with respect to the
various optimization parameters yield expressions used in the
evaluation of gradients like
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{\partial w_{ij}}=-x_ih_j,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{\partial a_i}=-x_i,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{\partial b_j}=-h_j.
\]
!et




!split
===== Boltzmann Machines, marginal and conditional probabilities  =====

A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a
probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model
of the probability distribution from which the training data was
drawn. As an example
o A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.
o Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered Ising model phase, having been given samples of such phases.
o Model the trial function for Monte Carlo calculations

!split
===== Generative and discriminative models =====

Generative and discriminative models use both gradient-descent based
learning procedures for minimizing cost functions

However, in energy based models we don't use backpropagation and automatic
differentiation for computing gradients, instead we turn to Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods.

A typical deep neural network has several hidden layers. A restricted
Boltzmann machine has normally one hidden layer, however several RBMs can
be stacked to make up deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute
the building blocks.

!split
===== Basics of the Boltzmann machine =====
!bblock
A BM is what we would call an undirected probabilistic graphical model
with stochastic continuous or discrete units.
!eblock
!bblock
It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the
state of each unit(neurons/nodes) depends on the units it is connected
to. The weights in the network represent thus the strength of the
interaction between various units/nodes.
!eblock

!split
===== More about the basics =====
!bblock
A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\bm{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\bm{h}$.
!eblock

!bblock
Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.
!eblock

!bblock
BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning
!eblock

!split
===== Difficult to train =====

However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction
of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.  Here we take away all lateral
connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections
between nodes in the hidden layer.


!split
===== The network layers =====

o A function $\bm{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
o The function $\bm{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".


!split
===== Goal of hidden layer =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

!split
===== The parameters =====

The network parameters, to be optimized/learned:
o $\bm{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length $M$ as $\bm{x}$.
o $\bm{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same length $N$  as $\bm{h}$.
o $\bm{W}$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.

Note that we have specified the lengths of $bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$. These
lengths define the number of visible and hidden units, respectively.

!split
===== Joint distribution =====

The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Boltzmann distribution
!bt
\begin{align*}
	P_{rbm}(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{1}{Z(\bm{\Theta})} \exp{-(E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta}))},
\end{align*}
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function discussed earlier and defined as 
!bt
\begin{align*}
	Z(\bm{\Theta}) = \int \int \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta})} d\bm{x} d\bm{h}.
\end{align*}
!et
It is common to set  the temperature $T$ to one. It is omitted in the equations above. The energy is thus a dimensionless function.

!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\bm{x}, \bm{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.


!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs =====

There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta})$. The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align*}
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\end{align*}
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock


!split
===== Gaussian-binary RBM =====

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\begin{align*}
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\end{align*}
!et

This type of RBMs are useful when we model continuous data (i.e., we wish $\bm{x}$ to be continuous). The paramater $\sigma_i^2$ is meant to represent a variance and is foten just set to one.


!split
===== Cost function =====

When working with a training dataset, the most common training
approach is maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data. The
log likelihood characterizes the log-probability of generating the
observed data using our generative model. Using this method our cost
function is chosen as the negative log-likelihood. The learning then
consists of trying to find parameters that maximize the probability of
the dataset, and is known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

Denoting the parameters as $\bm{\Theta} = a_1,...,a_M,b_1,...,b_N,w_{11},...,w_{MN}$, the log-likelihood is given by
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L}(\{ \Theta_i \}) &= \langle \text{log} P_\theta(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} \\
	&= - \langle E(\bm{x}; \{ \Theta_i\}) \rangle_{data} - \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\}),
\end{align*}
!et
where we used that the normalization constant does not depend on the data, $\langle \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\}) \rangle = \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\})$
Our cost function is the negative log-likelihood, $\mathcal{C}(\{ \Theta_i \}) = - \mathcal{L}(\{ \Theta_i \})$

!split
===== Optimization / Training =====

The training procedure of choice often is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It consists of a series of iterations where we update the parameters according to the equation
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\bm{\Theta}_{k+1} = \bm{\Theta}_k - \eta \nabla \mathcal{C} (\bm{\Theta}_k)
\end{align*}
!et
at each $k$-th iteration. There are a range of variants of the algorithm which aim at making the learning rate $\eta$ more adaptive so the method might be more efficient while remaining stable.

!split
===== Gradients =====
We now need the gradient of the cost function in order to minimize it. We find that
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\{ \Theta_i\})}{\partial \Theta_i}
	&= \langle \frac{\partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i)}{\partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{data}
	+ \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\})}{\partial \Theta_i} \\
	&= \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model}.
\end{align*}
!et
!split
===== Simplifications =====

In order to simplify notation we defined the "operator"
!bt
\begin{align*}
	O_i(\bm{x}) = \frac{\partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i)}{\partial \Theta_i}, 
\end{align*}
!et
and used the statistical mechanics relationship between expectation values and the log-partition function:
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model} = \text{Tr} P_\Theta(\bm{x})O_i(\bm{x}) = - \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\})}{\partial \Theta_i}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Positive and negative phases =====
As discussed earlier, the data-dependent term in the gradient is known as the positive phase
of the gradient, while the model-dependent term is known as the
negative phase of the gradient. The aim of the training is to lower
the energy of configurations that are near observed data points
(increasing their probability), and raising the energy of
configurations that are far from observed data points (decreasing
their probability).

!split
===== Gradient examples =====
The gradient of the negative log-likelihood cost function of a Binary-Binary RBM is then
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial w_{ij}} =& \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{model} \\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial a_{ij}} =& \langle x_i \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i \rangle_{model} \\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial b_{ij}} =& \langle h_i \rangle_{data} - \langle h_i \rangle_{model}. \\
\end{align*}
!et
To get the expectation values with respect to the *data*, we set the visible units to each of the observed samples in the training data, then update the hidden units according to the conditional probability found before. We then average over all samples in the training data to calculate expectation values with respect to the data. 



!split
===== Kullback-Leibler relative entropy =====

When the goal of the training is to approximate a probability
distribution, as it is in generative modeling, another relevant
measure is the _Kullback-Leibler divergence_, also known as the
relative entropy or Shannon entropy. It is a non-symmetric measure of the
dissimilarity between two probability density functions $p$ and
$q$. If $p$ is the unkown probability which we approximate with $q$,
we can measure the difference by
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL}(p||q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p (\bm{x}) \log \frac{p(\bm{x})}{q(\bm{x})}  d\bm{x}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Kullback-Leibler divergence =====

Thus, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the
training data $f(\bm{x})$ and the model distribution $p(\bm{x}|
\bm{\Theta})$ is

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL} (f(\bm{x})|| p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})) =& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
	f (\bm{x}) \log \frac{f(\bm{x})}{p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})} d\bm{x} \\
	=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log f(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log
	p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}) d\bm{x} \\
	%=& \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log f(\bm{x})) - \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}))
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} - \langle \log p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \langle E(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \log Z \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \mathcal{C}_{LL} .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Maximizing log-likelihood =====

The first term is constant with respect to $\bm{\Theta}$ since
$f(\bm{x})$ is independent of $\bm{\Theta}$. Thus the Kullback-Leibler
Divergence is minimal when the second term is minimal. The second term
is the log-likelihood cost function, hence minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the
log-likelihood.


To further understand generative models it is useful to study the
gradient of the cost function which is needed in order to minimize it
using methods like stochastic gradient descent. 

!split
===== More on the partition function =====

The partition function is the generating function of
expectation values, in particular there are mathematical relationships
between expectation values and the log-partition function. In this
case we have
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{model}
	= \int p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}) \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} d\bm{x} 
	= -\frac{\partial \log Z(\Theta_i)}{ \partial  \Theta_i} .
\end{align*}
!et

Here $\langle \cdot \rangle_{model}$ is the expectation value over the model probability distribution $p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})$.

!split
===== Setting up for gradient descent calculations =====

Using the previous relationship we can express the gradient of the cost function as

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}_{LL}}{\partial \Theta_i}
	=& \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{data} + \frac{\partial \log Z(\Theta_i)}{ \partial  \Theta_i} \\
	=& \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{data} - \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{model} \\
	%=& \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model}
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Difference of moments =====

This expression shows that the gradient of the log-likelihood cost
function is a _difference of moments_, with one calculated from
the data and one calculated from the model. The data-dependent term is
called the _positive phase_ and the model-dependent term is
called the _negative phase_ of the gradient. We see now that
minimizing the cost function results in lowering the energy of
configurations $\bm{x}$ near points in the training data and
increasing the energy of configurations not observed in the training
data. That means we increase the model's probability of configurations
similar to those in the training data.

!split
===== More observations =====

The gradient of the cost function also demonstrates why gradients of
unsupervised, generative models must be computed differently from for
those of for example FNNs. While the data-dependent expectation value
is easily calculated based on the samples $\bm{x}_i$ in the training
data, we must sample from the model in order to generate samples from
which to caclulate the model-dependent term. We sample from the model
by using MCMC-based methods. We can not sample from the model directly
because the partition function $Z$ is generally intractable.


!split
===== Adding hyperparameters =====

As in supervised machine learning problems, the goal is also here to
perform well on _unseen_ data, that is to have good
generalization from the training data. The distribution $f(x)$ we
approximate is not the _true_ distribution we wish to estimate,
it is limited to the training data. Hence, in unsupervised training as
well it is important to prevent overfitting to the training data. Thus
it is common to add regularizers to the cost function in the same
manner as we discussed for say linear regression.


!split
===== Mathematical details =====

Because we are restricted to potential functions which are positive it
is convenient to express them as exponentials.

The original RBM had binary visible and hidden nodes. They were
showned to be universal approximators of discrete distributions.
It was also shown that adding hidden units yields
strictly improved modelling power.


!split
===== Binary-binary (BB) RBMs =====

The common choice of binary values
are 0 and 1. However, in some physics applications, -1 and 1 might be
a more natural choice. We will here use 0 and 1. We habe the energy function

!bt
\begin{align*}
	E_{BB}(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j.
\end{align*}
!et


!split
===== Marginal probability =====

We have the binary-binary marginal probability defined as 
!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB}(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) =& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta})} e^{\sum_i^M a_i x_i + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_{ij}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j} \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta})} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}}

with the partition function

!bt
\begin{align*}
	Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{\bm{x}, \bm{h}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}} .

===== Marginal Probability Density Function for the visible units  =====

In order to find the probability of any configuration of the visible units we derive the marginal probability density function.

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{x},\bm{\Theta}) =& \sum_{\bm{h}} p_{BB} (\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} \sum_{\bm{h}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \sum_{\bm{h}} e^{\sum_j^N (b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j})h_j} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \sum_{\bm{h}} \prod_j^N e^{ (b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j})h_j} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \bigg ( \sum_{h_1} e^{(b_1 + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast 1})h_1}
	\times \sum_{h_2} e^{(b_2 + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast 2})h_2} \times \nonumber \\
	& ... \times \sum_{h_2} e^{(b_N + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast N})h_N} \bigg ) \nonumber \\

	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}) .
\end{align*}

!split
===== Marginal probability for hidden units =====

A similar derivation yields the marginal probability of the hidden units

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{1}{Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta})} e^{\bm{b}^T \bm{h}} \prod_i^M (1 + e^{a_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h}}) .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Conditional Probability Density Functions =====

We derive the probability of the hidden units given the visible units using Bayes' rule
(we drop the explicit $\bm{\Theta}$ dependence)
!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{h}|\bm{x}) =& \frac{p_{BB} (\bm{x}, \bm{h})}{p_{BB} (\bm{x})} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{ \frac{1}{Z_{BB}}  e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}} }
	        {\frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}})} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{  e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} e^{ \sum_j^N (b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} ) h_j} }
	        { e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}})} \nonumber \\
	=& \prod_j^N \frac{ e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} ) h_j}  }
	{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}} \nonumber \\
	=& \prod_j^N p_{BB} (h_j| \bm{x}) .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== On and off probabilities =====

From this we find the probability of a hidden unit being "on" or "off":

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (h_j=1 | \bm{x}) =&   \frac{ e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} ) h_j}  }
	{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}} \\
	=&  \frac{ e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} )}  }
	{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}} \\
	=&  \frac{ 1 }{1 + e^{-(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j})} } ,
\end{align*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (h_j=0 | \bm{x}) =\frac{ 1 }{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}} } .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Conditional probability for visible units =====

Similarly we have that the conditional probability of the visible units given the hidden are

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{x}|\bm{h}) =& \prod_i^M \frac{ e^{ (a_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h}) x_i} }{ 1 + e^{a_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h}} } \\
	&= \prod_i^M p_{BB} (x_i | \bm{h}) .
\end{align*}
!et

We have
!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (x_i=1 | \bm{h}) =& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(a_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h} )}} \\
	p_{BB} (x_i=0 | \bm{h}) =& \frac{1}{1 + e^{a_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h} }} .

===== Marginal Probability Density Functions =====

We proceed to find the marginal probability densitites of the
Gaussian-binary RBM. We first marginalize over the binary hidden units
to find $p_{GB} (\bm{x})$

\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Then the visible units =====
We next marginalize over the visible units. This is the first time we
marginalize over continuous values. We rewrite the exponential factor
dependent on $\bm{x}$ as a Gaussian function before we integrate in
the last step.

===== Hidden units =====

The conditional probability of a binary hidden unit $h_j$ being on or off again takes the form of a sigmoid function

===== Comments =====

The form of these conditional probabilities explains the name
"Gaussian" and the form of the Gaussian-binary energy function. We see
that the conditional probability of $x_i$ given $\bm{h}$ is a normal
distribution with mean $b_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h}$ and variance
$\sigma_i^2$.

For the quantum mechanical calculations however, there are several ingredients which simplify our calculations.



!split
===== Neural Quantum States =====


The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on $\bm{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$
!bt
\begin{align*}
	F_{rbm}(\bm{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\bm{x},\mathbf{h})}
\end{align*}
!et
To find the marginal distribution of $\bm{x}$ we set:

!bt
\begin{align*}
	F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) &= \sum_\mathbf{h} F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) \\
				&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_\mathbf{h} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})}
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Model for the trial wave function =====
Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\Psi (\mathbf{X}) &= F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) \\
	&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\bm{h}} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})} \\
	&= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\{h_j\}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}} \\
	&= \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \sum_i^M \frac{x_i w_{ij}}{\sigma^2}}) \\
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Allowing for complex valued functions =====

The above wavefunction is the most general one because it allows for
complex valued wavefunctions. However it fundamentally changes the
probabilistic foundation of the RBM, because what is usually a
probability in the RBM framework is now a an amplitude. This means
that a lot of the theoretical framework usually used to interpret the
model, i.e. graphical models, conditional probabilities, and Markov
random fields, breaks down.

!split
===== Squared wave function =====
If we assume the wavefunction to be
positive definite, however, we can use the RBM to represent the squared
wavefunction, and thereby a probability. This also makes it possible
to sample from the model using Gibbs sampling, because we can obtain
the conditional probabilities.

!bt
\begin{align*}
	|\Psi (\mathbf{X})|^2 &= F_{rbm}(\mathbf{X}) \\
	\Rightarrow \Psi (\mathbf{X}) &= \sqrt{F_{rbm}(\mathbf{X})} \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}}\sqrt{\sum_{\{h_j\}} e^{-E(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{h})}} \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}} \sqrt{\sum_{\{h_j\}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(X_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{X_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}} }\\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(X_i - a_i)^2}{4\sigma^2}} \sqrt{\sum_{\{h_j\}} \prod_j^N e^{b_j h_j + \sum_i^M \frac{X_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}}} \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(X_i - a_i)^2}{4\sigma^2}} \sqrt{\prod_j^N \sum_{h_j}  e^{b_j h_j + \sum_i^M \frac{X_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}}} \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(X_i - a_i)^2}{4\sigma^2}} \prod_j^N \sqrt{e^0 + e^{b_j + \sum_i^M \frac{X_i w_{ij}}{\sigma^2}}} \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(X_i - a_i)^2}{4\sigma^2}} \prod_j^N \sqrt{1 + e^{b_j + \sum_i^M \frac{X_i w_{ij}}{\sigma^2}}} \\
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Cost function =====

This is where we deviate from what is common in machine
learning. Rather than defining a cost function based on some dataset,
our cost function is the energy of the quantum mechanical system. From
the variational principle we know that minimizing this energy should
lead to the ground state wavefunction. As stated previously the local
energy is given by

!bt
\begin{align*}
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\mathbf{H}} \Psi.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== And the gradient =====


!bt
\begin{align*}
	G_i = \frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \alpha_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \alpha_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \alpha_i} \rangle ),
\end{align*}
!et
where $\alpha_i = a_1,...,a_M,b_1,...,b_N,w_{11},...,w_{MN}$.


!split
===== Additional details =====

We use that $\frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \alpha_i} 
	= \frac{\partial \ln{\Psi}}{\partial \alpha_i}$,
and find

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\ln{\Psi({\mathbf{X}})} &= -\ln{Z} - \sum_m^M \frac{(X_m - a_m)^2}{2\sigma^2}
	+ \sum_n^N \ln({1 + e^{b_n + \sum_i^M \frac{X_i w_{in}}{\sigma^2}})}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Final equation =====
This gives

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial }{\partial a_m} \ln\Psi
	&= 	\frac{1}{\sigma^2} (X_m - a_m) \\
	\frac{\partial }{\partial b_n} \ln\Psi
	&=
	\frac{1}{e^{-b_n-\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum_i^M X_i w_{in}} + 1} \\
	\frac{\partial }{\partial w_{mn}} \ln\Psi
	&= \frac{X_m}{\sigma^2(e^{-b_n-\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum_i^M X_i w_{in}} + 1)}.

===== Project 2, VMC for fermions: Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
The potentially most time-consuming part is the
evaluation of the gradient and the Laplacian of an $N$-particle  Slater
determinant. 

We have to differentiate the determinant with respect to
all spatial coordinates of all particles. A brute force
differentiation would involve $N\cdot d$ evaluations of the entire
determinant which would even worsen the already undesirable time
scaling, making it $Nd\cdot O(N^3)\sim O(d\cdot N^4)$.

This poses serious hindrances to the overall efficiency of our code.

!eblock


!split
===== Matrix elements of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
The efficiency can be improved however if we move only one electron at the time.
The Slater determinant matrix $\hat{D}$ is defined by the matrix elements
!bt
\[
d_{ij}=\phi_j(x_i)
\]
!et
where $\phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)$ is a single particle  wave function.
The columns correspond to the position of a given particle 
while the rows stand for the various quantum numbers.

===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock

What we need to realize is that when differentiating a Slater
determinant with respect to some given coordinate, only one row of the
corresponding Slater matrix is changed. 

Therefore, by recalculating
the whole determinant we risk producing redundant information. The
solution turns out to be an algorithm that requires to keep track of
the *inverse* of the Slater matrix.

===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock

Let the current position in phase space be represented by the $(N\cdot d)$-element 
vector $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}$ and the new suggested
position by the vector $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}$.

The inverse of $\hat{D}$ can be expressed in terms of its
cofactors $C_{ij}$ and its determinant (this our notation for a determinant) $\vert\hat{D}\vert$:
!bt
\begin{equation}
d_{ij}^{-1} = \frac{C_{ji}}{\vert\hat{D}\vert}
label{eq:inverse_cofactor}
\end{equation}
!et
Notice that the interchanged indices indicate that the matrix of cofactors is to be transposed.


!eblock


!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
If $\hat{D}$ is invertible, then we must obviously have $\hat{D}^{-1}\hat{D}= \mathbf{1}$, or explicitly in terms of the individual
elements of $\hat{D}$ and $\hat{D}^{-1}$:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^N d_{ik}^{\phantom X}d_{kj}^{-1} = \delta_{ij}^{\phantom X}
label{eq:unity_explicitely}
\end{equation}
!et

===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
Consider the ratio, which we shall call $R$, between $\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\vert$ and $\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\vert$. 
By definition, each of these determinants can
individually be expressed in terms of the *i*-th row of its cofactor
matrix
!bt
\begin{equation}
R\equiv\frac{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\vert}
{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\vert} =
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})}
{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\,
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})}
label{eq:detratio_cofactors}
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
Suppose now that we move only one particle  at a time, meaning that
$\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}$ differs from $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}$ by the
position of only one, say the *i*-th, particle . This means that $\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})$ and $\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})$ differ
only by the entries of the *i*-th row.  Recall also that the *i*-th row
of a cofactor matrix $\hat{C}$ is independent of the entries of the
*i*-th row of its corresponding matrix $\hat{D}$. In this particular
case we therefore get that the *i*-th row of $\hat{C}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})$ 
and $\hat{C}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})$ must be
equal. Explicitly, we have:
!bt
\begin{equation}
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}) = C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\quad
\forall\ j\in\{1,\dots,N\}
\end{equation}
!et

!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
Inserting this into the numerator of eq.~(ref{eq:detratio_cofactors})
and using eq.~(ref{eq:inverse_cofactor}) to substitute the cofactors
with the elements of the inverse matrix, we get:
!bt
\begin{equation}
R =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})}
{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\,
C_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})} =
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})}
{\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})}
\end{equation}
!et


!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock

Now by eq.~(ref{eq:unity_explicitely}) the denominator of the rightmost
expression must be unity, so that we finally arrive at:
!bt
\begin{equation}
R =
\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}) = 
\sum_{j=1}^N \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})
label{eq:detratio_inverse}
\end{equation}
!et
What this means is that in order to get the ratio when only the *i*-th
particle  has been moved, we only need to calculate the dot
product of the vector $\left(\phi_1(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new}),\,\dots,\,\phi_N(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new})\right)$ of single particle  wave functions
evaluated at this new position with the *i*-th column of the inverse
matrix $\hat{D}^{-1}$ evaluated at the original position. Such
an operation has a time scaling of $O(N)$. The only extra thing we
need to do is to maintain the inverse matrix $\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{old}})$.

!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
If the new position $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}$ is accepted, then the
inverse matrix can by suitably updated by an algorithm having a time
scaling of $O(N^2)$.  This algorithm goes as
follows. First we update all but the *i*-th column of $\hat{D}^{-1}$. For each column $j\neq i$, we first calculate the quantity:
!bt
\begin{equation}
S_j =
(\hat{D}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\times
\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}))_{ij} =
\sum_{l=1}^N d_{il}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d^{-1}_{lj}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})
label{eq:inverse_update_1}
\end{equation}
!et


!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock
The new elements of the *j*-th column of $\hat{D}^{-1}$ are then given
by:
!bt
\begin{equation}
d_{kj}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}) =
d_{kj}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}) -
\frac{S_j}{R}\,d_{ki}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\quad
\begin{array}{ll}
\forall\ \ k\in\{1,\dots,N\}\\j\neq i
\end{array}
label{eq:inverse_update_2}
\end{equation}
!et

!eblock
!split
===== Efficient calculation of Slater determinants =====
!bblock

Finally the elements of the *i*-th column of $\hat{D}^{-1}$ are updated
simply as follows:
!bt
\begin{equation}
d_{ki}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}}) =
\frac{1}{R}\,d_{ki}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})\quad
\forall\ \ k\in\{1,\dots,N\}
label{eq:inverse_update_3}
\end{equation}
!et
We see from these formulas that the time scaling of an update of
$\hat{D}^{-1}$ after changing one row of $\hat{D}$ is $O(N^2)$.


The scheme is also applicable for the calculation of the ratios
involving derivatives. It turns
out that differentiating the Slater determinant with respect
to the coordinates of a single particle  $\mathbf{r}_i$ changes only the
*i*-th row of the corresponding Slater matrix. 

!eblock


!split
===== The gradient and the Laplacian =====
!bblock
The gradient and the Laplacian can therefore be calculated as follows:
!bt
\[
\frac{\vec\nabla_i\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert}{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \vec\nabla_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \vec\nabla_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r})
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\nabla^2_i\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert}{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \nabla^2_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \nabla^2_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)\,d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r})
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== How to compute the derivates of the Slater determinant =====
!bblock

Thus, to calculate all the derivatives of the Slater determinant, we
only need the derivatives of the single particle  wave functions
($\vec\nabla_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)$ and $\nabla^2_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)$)
and the elements of the corresponding inverse Slater matrix ($\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}_i)$). A calculation of a single derivative is by the
above result an $O(N)$ operation. Since there are $d\cdot N$
derivatives, the time scaling of the total evaluation becomes
$O(d\cdot N^2)$. With an $O(N^2)$ updating algorithm for the
inverse matrix, the total scaling is no worse, which is far better
than the brute force approach yielding $O(d\cdot N^4)$.

_Important note_: In most cases you end with closed form expressions for the single-particle  wave functions. It is then useful to calculate the various derivatives and make separate functions
for them.

!eblock

!split
===== The Slater determinant  =====
!bblock

The Slater determinant takes the form  
!bt
\[
   \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,,\mathbf{r}_3,\mathbf{r}_4, \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4!}}
\left| \begin{array}{cccc} \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)& \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)&\psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_4) \\
\psi_{100\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{100\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)& \psi_{100\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)&\psi_{100\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_4) \\
\psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)& \psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)&\psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_4) \\
\psi_{200\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{200\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)& \psi_{200\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)&\psi_{200\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_4) \end{array} \right|.
\]
!et
The Slater determinant as written is zero since the spatial wave functions for the spin up and spin down 
states are equal.  
But we can rewrite it as the product of two Slater determinants, one for spin up and one for spin down.
!eblock

!split
===== Rewriting the Slater determinant =====
!bblock
We can rewrite it as 
!bt
\[
   \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,,\mathbf{r}_3,\mathbf{r}_4, \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)=\det\uparrow(1,2)\det\downarrow(3,4)-\det\uparrow(1,3)\det\downarrow(2,4)
\]
!et
!bt
\[
-\det\uparrow(1,4)\det\downarrow(3,2)+\det\uparrow(2,3)\det\downarrow(1,4)-\det\uparrow(2,4)\det\downarrow(1,3)
\]
!et
!bt
\[
+\det\uparrow(3,4)\det\downarrow(1,2),
\]
!et
where we have defined
!bt
\[
\det\uparrow(1,2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left| \begin{array}{cc} \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{100\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)\\
\psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1)& \psi_{200\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2) \end{array} \right|,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\det\downarrow(3,4)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left| \begin{array}{cc} \psi_{100\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)& \psi_{100\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_4)\\
\psi_{200\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_3)& \psi_{200\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_4) \end{array} \right|.
\]
!et
The total determinant is still zero!

!eblock

!split
===== Splitting the Slater determinant =====
!bblock

We want to avoid to sum over spin variables, in particular when the interaction does not depend on spin.

It can be shown, see for example Moskowitz and Kalos, "Int.~J.~Quantum Chem. _20_ 1107 (1981)": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qua.560200508/abstract", that for the variational energy
we can approximate the Slater determinant as  
!bt
\[
   \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,,\mathbf{r}_3,\mathbf{r}_4, \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) \propto \det\uparrow(1,2)\det\downarrow(3,4),
\]
!et
or more generally as 
!bt
\[
   \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\dots \mathbf{r}_N) \propto \det\uparrow \det\downarrow,
\]
!et
where we have the Slater determinant as the product of a spin up part involving the number of electrons with spin up only (2 for beryllium and 5 for neon) and a spin down part involving the electrons with spin down.

This ansatz is not antisymmetric under the exchange of electrons with  opposite spins but it can be shown (show this) that it gives the same
expectation value for the energy as the full Slater determinant.

As long as the Hamiltonian is spin independent, the above is correct. It is rather straightforward to see this if you go back to the equations for the energy discussed earlier  this semester.

!split
===== Spin up and spin down parts =====
!bblock

We will thus
factorize the full determinant $\vert\hat{D}\vert$ into two smaller ones, where 
each can be identified with $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$
respectively:
!bt
\[
\vert\hat{D}\vert = \vert\hat{D}\vert_\uparrow\cdot \vert\hat{D}\vert_\downarrow
\]
!et

!eblock

!split
===== Factorization =====
!bblock
The combined dimensionality of the two smaller determinants equals the
dimensionality of the full determinant. Such a factorization is
advantageous in that it makes it possible to perform the calculation
of the ratio $R$ and the updating of the inverse matrix separately for
$\vert\hat{D}\vert_\uparrow$ and $\vert\hat{D}\vert_\downarrow$:
!bt
\[
\frac{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{new}}{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{old}} =
\frac{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{new}_\uparrow}
{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{old}_\uparrow}\cdot
\frac{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{new}_\downarrow
}{\vert\hat{D}\vert^\mathrm{old}_\downarrow}
\]
!et


This reduces the calculation time by a constant factor. The maximal
time reduction happens in a system of equal numbers of $\uparrow$ and
$\downarrow$ particles, so that the two factorized determinants are
half the size of the original one.

!split
===== Number of operations =====
!bblock
Consider the case of moving only one particle  at a time which
originally had the following time scaling for one transition:
!bt
\[
O_R(N)+O_\mathrm{inverse}(N^2)
\]
!et
For the factorized determinants one of the two determinants is
obviously unaffected by the change so that it cancels from the ratio
$R$. 


!eblock

!split
===== Counting the number of FLOPS =====
!bblock
Therefore, only one determinant of size $N/2$ is involved in each
calculation of $R$ and update of the inverse matrix. The scaling of
each transition then becomes:
!bt
\[
O_R(N/2)+O_\mathrm{inverse}(N^2/4)
\]
!et
and the time scaling when the transitions for all $N$ particles are
put together:
!bt
\[
O_R(N^2/2)+O_\mathrm{inverse}(N^3/4)
\]
!et
which gives the same reduction as in the case of moving all particles
at once.
!eblock

!split
===== Computation of ratios =====
!bblock

Computing the ratios discussed above requires that we maintain 
the inverse of the Slater matrix evaluated at the current position. 
Each time a trial position is accepted, the row number $i$ of the Slater 
matrix changes and updating its inverse has to be carried out. 
Getting the inverse of an $N \times N$ matrix by Gaussian elimination has a 
complexity of order of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ operations, a luxury that we 
cannot afford for each time a particle  move is accepted.
We will use the expression
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{updatingInverse}
d^{-1}_{kj}(\mathbf{x^{new}}) = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
  d^{-1}_{kj}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) - \frac{d^{-1}_{ki}(\mathbf{x^{old}})}{R} \sum_{l=1}^{N} d_{il}(\mathbf{x^{new}})  d^{-1}_{lj}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) & \mbox{if $j \neq i$}\nonumber \\ \\
 \frac{d^{-1}_{ki}(\mathbf{x^{old}})}{R} \sum_{l=1}^{N} d_{il}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) d^{-1}_{lj}(\mathbf{x^{old}}) & \mbox{if $j=i$}
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

===== Scaling properties =====
!bblock
This equation scales as $O(N^2)$.
The evaluation of the determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix by standard Gaussian elimination 
requires $\mathbf{O}(N^3)$
calculations. 
As there are $Nd$ independent coordinates we need to evaluate $Nd$ Slater determinants 
for the gradient (quantum force) and $Nd$ for the Laplacian (kinetic energy). 
With the updating algorithm we need only to invert the Slater 
determinant matrix once. This can be done by standard LU decomposition methods.

===== How to get the determinant =====
!bblock
Determining a determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix by
standard Gaussian elimination is of the order of $\mathbf{O}(N^3)$
calculations. As there are $N\cdot d$ independent coordinates we need
to evaluate $Nd$ Slater determinants for the gradient (quantum force) and
$N\cdot d$ for the Laplacian (kinetic energy)

With the updating algorithm we need only to invert the Slater determinant matrix once.
This is done by calling standard LU decomposition methods.

!bt
\[
\Psi_{C}=\prod_{i< j}\exp{f(r_{ij})}= \exp{\left\{\sum_{i<j}\frac{ar_{ij}}{1+\beta r_{ij}}\right\}},
\]
!et
and it is easy to see that for particle  $k$
we have
!bt
\[
  \frac{\nabla^2_k \Psi_C}{\Psi_C }=
\sum_{ij\ne k}\frac{(\mathbf{r}_k-\mathbf{r}_i)(\mathbf{r}_k-\mathbf{r}_j)}{r_{ki}r_{kj}}f'(r_{ki})f'(r_{kj})+
\sum_{j\ne k}\left( f''(r_{kj})+\frac{2}{r_{kj}}f'(r_{kj})\right)
\]

===== Second derivative of the Jastrow factor =====

Using

\[

\]
!et
and $g'(r_{kj})=dg(r_{kj})/dr_{kj}$ and 
$g''(r_{kj})=d^2g(r_{kj})/dr_{kj}^2$  we find that for particle  $k$
we have
!bt
\[
  \frac{\nabla^2_k \Psi_C}{\Psi_C }=
\sum_{ij\ne k}\frac{(\mathbf{r}_k-\mathbf{r}_i)(\mathbf{r}_k-\mathbf{r}_j)}{r_{ki}r_{kj}}\frac{a}{(1+\beta r_{ki})^2}
\frac{a}{(1+\beta r_{kj})^2}+
\sum_{j\ne k}\left(\frac{2a}{r_{kj}(1+\beta r_{kj})^2}-\frac{2a\beta}{(1+\beta r_{kj})^3}\right)

===== Gradient and Laplacian =====

The gradient and
Laplacian can be calculated as follows:
!bt
\[
\frac{\mathbf{\nabla}_i\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert}
{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \vec\nabla_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \vec\nabla_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r})
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\nabla^2_i\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert}
{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \nabla^2_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \nabla^2_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r})
\]

===== The gradient for the determinant  =====
!bblock
The gradient for the determinant is 
!bt
\[

{\vert\hat{D}(\mathbf{r})\vert} =
\sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{\nabla}_i d_{ij}(\mathbf{r})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}) =
\sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{\nabla}_i \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i)\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}).

===== Jastrow gradient in quantum force =====
!bblock
We have
!bt
\[
\Psi_C=\prod_{i< j}g(r_{ij})= \exp{\left\{\sum_{i<j}\frac{ar_{ij}}{1+\beta r_{ij}}\right\}},
\]
!et
the gradient needed for the quantum force and local energy is easy to compute.  
We get for particle  $k$
!bt
\[
\frac{ \nabla_k \Psi_C}{ \Psi_C }= \sum_{j\ne k}\frac{\mathbf{r}_{kj}}{r_{kj}}\frac{a}{(1+\beta r_{kj})^2},
\]
!et
which is rather easy to code.  Remember to sum over all particles  when you compute the local energy.


!eblock

!split
===== Metropolis Hastings part =====
!bblock
We need to compute the ratio between wave functions, in particular  for the Slater determinants.
!bt
\[
R =\sum_{j=1}^N d_{ij}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}}) = 
\sum_{j=1}^N \phi_j(\mathbf{r}_i^{\mathrm{new}})\,
d_{ji}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{old}})
\]
!et
What this means is that in order to get the ratio when only the *i*-th
particle  has been moved, we only need to calculate the dot
product of the vector $\left(\phi_1(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new}),\,\dots,\,
\phi_N(\mathbf{r}_i^\mathrm{new})\right)$ of single particle  wave functions
evaluated at this new position with the *i*-th column of the inverse
matrix $\hat{D}^{-1}$ evaluated at the original position. Such
an operation has a time scaling of $O(N)$. The only extra thing we
need to do is to maintain the inverse matrix 
$\hat{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{old}})$.
