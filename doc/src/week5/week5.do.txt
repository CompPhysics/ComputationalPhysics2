===== Importance sampling =====

Here we will use the material from the previous week, see the "Jupyter-notebook":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics2/blob/gh-pages/doc/pub/week4/ipynb/week4.ipynb"

===== Motivation  ===== 
!bblock
Our aim with this part of the project is to be able to
* find an optimal value for the variational parameters using only some few Monte Carlo cycles
* use these optimal values for the variational parameters to perform a large-scale Monte Carlo calculation

To achieve this will look at methods like standard *Gradtient Descent*, *Sochastic gradient descent*, *Stochastic reconfigurations*, *Steepest descent* and the *conjugate gradient method*. All these methods allow us to find
the minima of a multivariable  function like our energy (function of several variational parameters). 
Alternatively, you can always use Newton's method. In particular, since we will normally have one variational parameter,
Newton's method can be easily used in finding the minimum of the local energy. However, as we will see, the latter requires that we can evaluate the second derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameters.

===== Simple example and demonstration ===== 

Let us illustrate what is needed in our calculations using a simple example, the harmonic oscillator in one dimension.
For the harmonic oscillator in one-dimension we have a  trial wave function and probability
!bt
\[
\psi_T(x;\alpha) = \exp{-(\frac{1}{2}\alpha^2x^2)},
\]
!et 
which results in a local energy 
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2+x^2(1-\alpha^4)\right).
\]
!et
We can compare our numerically calculated energies with the exact energy as function of $\alpha$
!bt
\[
\overline{E}[\alpha] = \frac{1}{4}\left(\alpha^2+\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\right).
\]
!et


!split
===== Simple example and demonstration ===== 
!bblock
The derivative of the energy with respect to $\alpha$ gives
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha} = \frac{1}{2}\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha^3}
\end{equation*}
!et
and a second derivative which is always positive (meaning that we find a minimum)
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha^2} = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2\alpha^4}
\end{equation*}
!et
The condition
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha} = 0,
\end{equation*}
!et
gives the optimal $\alpha=1$, as expected.

!split
===== Variance in the simple model ===== 
!bblock
We can also minimize the variance. In our simple model the variance is

!bt
\[
\sigma^2[\alpha]=\frac{1}{4}\left(1+(1-\alpha^4)^2\frac{3}{4\alpha^4}\right)-\overline{E}^2.
\]
!et
which yields a second derivative which is always positive.
!eblock


!split
===== Computing the derivatives ===== 
!bblock

In general we end up computing the expectation value of the energy in terms 
of some parameters $\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$
and we search for a minimum in this multi-variable parameter space.  
This leads to an energy minimization problem *where we need the derivative of the energy as a function of the variational parameters*.

In the above example this was easy and we were able to find the expression for the derivative by simple derivations. 
However, in our actual calculations the energy is represented by a multi-dimensional integral with several variational parameters.
How can we can then obtain the derivatives of the energy with respect to the variational parameters without having 
to resort to expensive numerical derivations?

===== Expressions for finding the derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock

To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define 
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha}=\frac{d\langle  E_L[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha}.
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha$ (we limit ourselves to one parameter only).
In the above example this was easy and we obtain a simple expression for the derivative.
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}=\frac{d\psi[\alpha]\rangle}{d\alpha}.
\]
!et  
!eblock



!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are then (using the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha} = 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}E_L[\alpha]\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}\rangle\langle E_L[\alpha] \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}E_L[\alpha]\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}\rangle\langle E_L[\alpha]\rangle
\]
!et
!eblock

!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha} = 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}E_L[\alpha]\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\psi}_{\alpha}}{\psi[\alpha]}\rangle\langle E_L[\alpha] \rangle\right).
\]
