<h3 id="some-basic-ingredients-for-a-successful-numerical-project">Some basic ingredients for a successful numerical project</h3>
<p>When building up a numerical project there are several elements you should think of, amongst these we take the liberty of mentioning the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to structure a code in terms of functions</li>
<li>How to make a module</li>
<li>How to read input data flexibly from the command line</li>
<li>How to create graphical/web user interfaces</li>
<li>How to write unit tests (test functions)</li>
<li>How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only), in our case you think of a system and a solver class</li>
<li>How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments</li>
<li>How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)</li>
</ul>
<p>The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)</li>
<li>Programs are run through convenient user interfaces</li>
<li>It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing</li>
<li>Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,</li>
<li>Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-report-how-to-write-a-good-scienfitictechnical-report">The report: how to write a good scienfitic/technical report</h3>
<p>What should it contain? A typical structure</p>
<ul>
<li>An abstract where you give the main summary of your work</li>
<li>An introduction where you explain the aims and rationale for the physics case and what you have done. At the end of the introduction you should give a brief summary of the structure of the report</li>
<li>Theoretical models and technicalities. This is the methods section</li>
<li>Results and discussion</li>
<li>Conclusions and perspectives</li>
<li>Appendix with extra material</li>
<li>Bibliography</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep always a good log of what you do.</p>
<h3 id="the-report-the-abstract">The report, the abstract</h3>
<p>The abstract gives the reader a quick overview of what has been done and the most important results. Try to be to the point and state your main findings.</p>
<h3 id="the-report-the-introduction">The report, the introduction</h3>
<p>When you write the introduction you could focus on the following aspects</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivate the reader, the first part of the introduction gives always a motivation and tries to give the overarching ideas</li>
<li>What I have done</li>
<li>The structure of the report, how it is organized etc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-report-discussion-of-methods-implementation-codes-etc">The report, discussion of methods, implementation, codes etc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describe the methods and algorithms</li>
<li>You need to explain how you implemented the methods and also say something about the structure of your algorithm and present some parts of your code</li>
<li>You should plug in some calculations to demonstrate your code, such as selected runs used to validate and verify your results. The latter is extremely important!! A reader needs to understand that your code reproduces selected benchmarks and reproduces previous results, either numerical and/or well-known closed form expressions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-report-results-part">The report, results part</h3>
<ul>
<li>Present your results</li>
<li>Give a critical discussion of your work and place it in the correct context.</li>
<li>Relate your work to other calculations/studies</li>
<li>An eventual reader should be able to reproduce your calculations if she/he wants to do so. All input variables should be properly explained.</li>
<li>Make sure that figures and tables should contain enough information in their captions, axis labels etc so that an eventual reader can gain a first impression of your work by studying figures and tables only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-report-conclusions-and-perspectives">The report, conclusions and perspectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>State your main findings and interpretations</li>
<li>Try as far as possible to present perspectives for future work</li>
<li>Try to discuss the pros and cons of the methods and possible improvements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-report-appendices">The report, appendices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Additional calculations used to validate the codes</li>
<li>Selected calculations, these can be listed with few comments</li>
<li>Listing of the code if you feel this is necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>You can consider moving parts of the material from the methods section to the appendix. You can also place additional material on your webpage or GitHub page..</p>
<h3 id="the-report-references">The report, references</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give always references to material you base your work on, either scientific articles/reports or books.</li>
<li>Refer to articles as: name(s) of author(s), journal, volume (boldfaced), page and year in parenthesis.</li>
<li>Refer to books as: name(s) of author(s), title of book, publisher, place and year, eventual page numbers</li>
</ul>
