\subsection{Path Integrals: Concepts and Formalism}

In the path integral formalism the evolution from a state $\ket{x_i}$ do a state $\ket{x_f}$ from time $t_i$ to time $t_f$ is given by:

\[
	\bra{x_f}e^{-\hat{H}(t_f-t_i)}\ket{x_i} = \int \D x(t) e^{-S[x]}
\]

On the lhs we have the standard quantum mechanical time evolution operator with $\hat{H}$ being the Hamiltonian operator of the system, the rhs represents the path integral of all possible paths x(t) from $x_i$ to $x_f$ with $t = t_i \rightarrow t_f$ weighted with the classical action $S[x]$:

\[
	S[x] = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} dt L(x,\dot{x}) =  \int_{t_i}^{t_f} dt \left( \frac{m\dot{x}(t)^2}{2} - V(x(t))\right),
\]

and  knowledge of the propagator gives full information about the system.

In a simple one dimensional case the path integral can be seen as:

\[
	 \int \D x(t) \rightarrow \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx_1dx_2\dots dx_{N-1}
\]

where the time has been discretized in N slices from $t_i = t_0$ to $t_f = t_N$. Consequently $x_i = x(t_i)$.  

Given some functional $\Gamma[x]$ that represents an observable at intermediate times of the evolution of the system we can write its expectation value as:

\[
	\braket{\Gamma[x]} = \frac{1}{Z} \int \D x(t) \Gamma[x] e^{-S[x]}
\]

where the normalization $Z$ is given by 

\[
	Z = \int \D x(t) e^{-S[x]}
\]

This can be computed using a set of configurations $x^{(k)} = \{x^{(k)}_1x^{(k)}_2\dots x^{(k)}_{N-1} \}$ for $k = 1,2,\dots N_{cf}$. The Monte Carlo estimator then becomes:

\[
	\braket{\Gamma[x]} \approx \bar{\Gamma} = \frac{1}{N_{cf}} \sum_{k = 1}^k \Gamma[x^{(k)}]
\]

As and aside, when we generalize our theory to a four dimensional
euclidean space time an observable that depends on a scalar field can
be computed in a very similar fashion as we just described:

\[
	\braket{\Gamma[\phi]} = \frac{1}{Z} \int \D \phi \Gamma[\phi] e^{-S[\phi]}
\]

where the normalization $Z$ is given again by 

\[
	Z = \int \D \phi e^{-S[\phi]}
\]

But this time the path integral can be computed numerically by discretizing the 4 dimensional space in a lattice:

\[
	 \int \D \phi \rightarrow \int \prod_{x_i \in lattice} d\phi(x_i)
\] 

\subsection{The Harmonic Oscillator: a Simple Example}

\paragraph{Project 2 a):}
A first example of the path integral solution of quantum mechanical systems is  the 1D Harmonic Oscillator. It is particularly well suited because of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item simple dimensional discretization

\item well known results for expectation values

\item fast analytical analysis, implementation and runs 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The classical action for the harmonic oscillator is given by:

\[
	S[x] = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \left[ \frac{m\dot{x}(t)^2}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\omega x(t)^2\right] dt.
\]

We can discretize the time domain into $N$ slices of step $a$, which imposes us to discretize the time derivative of the position as well. When considering the integral between time $t_j$ and $t_{j+1}$ the action becomes:

\[
	S_{j} \approx a\left[ \frac{m(x_{j+1}-x_j)^2}{2a^2} + \frac{1}{4}\omega (x_{j+1} - x_j)^2 \right] dt.
\]
When summing over all time slices (and applying periodic boundary conditions) we get
\[	
	S_{latt} = \sum_{j = 0}^{N-1} \left[ \frac{m}{2a}(x_{j+1}-x_j)^2 + \frac{a}{2} x_j^2 \right]
\]
In order to extract information from the system we need to construct and study an observable. We can look at a two point correlator of the form $\langle x(t_2)x(t_1) \rangle$.  
In the continuum this is equivalent to the calculation of the ratio of path integrals:

\[
	\langle x(t_2)x(t_1) \rangle = \frac{\int \D x(t) x(t_2) x(t_1) e^{-S[x]}}{\int \D x(t) e^{-S[x]}}
\]

In quantum mechanics the numerator (using the definition of the path integral) is equal to:

\[	
	\int dx \bra{x} e^{\bar{H}(t_f-t2)} \tilde{x} e^{\bar{H}(t_2-t1)} \tilde{x} e^{\bar{H}(t_1-ti)} \ket{x}
\]

If we look at the full integral, let the hamiltionian operator act on the states leaving the spectral decomposition of them, and substitute $T = t_f-Ti$ and $t = t_2 - t_1$ we get to:

\[
	\langle x(t_2)x(t_1) \rangle = \frac{\sum e^{-E_n T} \bra{E_n} \tilde{x} e^{-(\bar{H}-E_n)t}  \tilde{x}\ket{E_n}}{\sum e^{-E_n T }}
\]
and for $T \gg t$ the ground state will dominate the summation:

\[
	G(t) = \langle x(t_2)x(t_1)\rangle \rightarrow  \bra{E_0} \tilde{x} e^{-(\bar{H}-E_0)t}  \tilde{x}\ket{E_0}
\]

and letting $t$ to be large as well the propagator ends up linking the two lowest energy states:

\[
	G(t) \rightarrow  |\bra{E_0} \tilde{x} \ket{E_1}|^2e^{-(E_1-E_0)t}
\]
We can now extract the first excitation energy of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator, in the limit of $t$ large, as:

\[
	\log\left( \frac{G(t)}{G(t+\Delta t)}\right) = (E_1 - E_0)\Delta t
\]
On our discretized lattice the correlator can be obtained numerically by directly computing the average value of the operator:

\[
	G(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_j\langle\braket{x(t_j+t)x(t_j)}\rangle
\]
for all $t$ in $0, a, 2a\dots (N-1)a$. This might look trivial at a first glance, but it is the key point of the whole algorithm

The computational algorithm required to compute the correlator is based on the idea of creating a Markov chain of possible paths for the harmonic oscillator, via subsequent updates. This procedure is called Metropolis algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item initialize an array of $N$ position values for each time point (for example set everything to 0)

\item suggest a new random configuration starting from the current one

\item accept or reject the update, based on the action difference

\item compute the correlator for the current configuration

\item repeat the process $N_{cf}$ times, sufficiently large to have a statistically relevant ensemble.

\item In order to limit the auto correlation between data, the observable is only computed once every $N_{corr}$ updates. 

\item The rule for accepting an update is: $\exp(-\Delta S) > \xi$. Where $\xi \in [0,1]$, a randomly chosen number. This implies that if the classical action is reduced the update is automatically accepted, if it is positive, a random number $\xi$ is generated and compared with the exponential of the action. This condition allows the system to explore all the phase space and not get stuck in a local minimum for example.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Run for the HO using $10^5$ configurations ($N_{conf}$), skipping 20 updates between every measurement ($N_{corr}$). The time axis is discretized into 20 nodes. Data, to improve the estimate of the error bars. These can be  resampled using the bootstrap or the blocking techniques. 
The result that is physically relevant is the first excitation energy, which we expect to be $1\hbar\omega$. For simplicity we set $\hbar=\omega=1$ and the lattice spacing parameter $a = 0.5$.

Implement statistical bootstrapping and blocking. 
Estimate energy and how it relates  with the correlation time.

\subsection{Introduction to numerical projects}

Here follows a brief recipe and recommendation on how to write a report for each
project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual  numerical methods you have used.

  \item Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.

  \item Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.

  \item If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.

  \item Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.

  \item Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.

  \item Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.

  \item Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.

  \item Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Format for electronic delivery of report and programs}

The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also use DOC or postscript formats or as an ipython notebook file.  As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python. The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use canvas to hand in your projects, log in  at  \href{{http://canvas.uio.no}}{\nolinkurl{http://canvas.uio.no}} with your normal UiO username and password.

  \item Upload \textbf{only} the report file!  For the source code file(s) you have developed please provide us with your link to your github domain.  The report file should include all of your discussions and a list of the codes you have developed.  The full version of the codes should be in your github repository.

  \item In your github repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.

  \item Still in your github make a folder where you place your codes. 

  \item In this and all later projects, you should include tests (for example unit tests) of your code(s).

  \item Comments  from us on your projects, approval or not, corrections to be made  etc can be found under your Devilry domain and are only visible to you and the teachers of the course.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Finally, 
we encourage you to work two and two together. Optimal working groups consist of 
2-3 students. You can then hand in a common report. 

In this project the aim is to explore the Heisenberg-model in 1D {\&} 2D, by use of stochastic series expansion (SSE). Hopefully, we will be able to calculate the critical temperature for the continious phase transition. With this value the critical exponents for the system can also be obtained.
The results should be compared with the relevant literature as provided in the references.

Implementation of SSE for 1D Heisenberg model with periodic bound- ary conditions.
2. Add external field and anisotropy dependencies.
3. 2D implementation, again with periodic boundary conditions.
4. Study the temperature dependent phase transition and calculate the critical exponents for the system. By studying the system the follow- ing values should be attainable; ⟨m⟩, ⟨m2⟩, ⟨E⟩, χ, cV , C(r), where m is magnetization, E is the energy, χ is the magnetic suceptibility, cV is the heat capacity and C(r) is the correlation length.
