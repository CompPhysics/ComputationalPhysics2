    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do people care about \"Quantum Machine Learning\", or \"Quantum Computing\" in general? A common observation that motivates quantum computing,\n",
    "although it does not tell the whole story, is the striking fact than quantum information of a quantum system is in a sense\n",
    "larger than the classical information of a comparable classical system. In the case of\n",
    "bits and qubits, $n$ classical bits allows you to store the value of $n$ boolean variables $a \\in [0,1]$,\n",
    "whereas you need $2^n$ amplitudes $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to describe the state of $n$ quantum bits, or qubits.\n",
    "In other words, the (Hilbert )space in which the qubits live in exponentially bigger than that of the classical\n",
    "counterpart. In the context of parameterized quantum circuits, one may prepare a state in the exponentially\n",
    "large Hilbert space by applying some simple quantum operations to a set qubits that are all initialized in the zero-state.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "By varying $\\theta_i \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, one can attain different states. A crucial thing to note is that we are not\n",
    "able to prepare an arbitrary state using this ansatz as it much too constrained and simple: The exponentially large\n",
    "space is not available to us. One might try to remedy this by introducing a more complex ansatz:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have an ansatz whose number of operations scales polynomially in the number of qubits(in this case quadratic), and the\n",
    "added complexity enables us to reach a greater part of Hilbert space. Still, it is only a polynomially large part of it, which\n",
    "is vanishingly small compared to its full size. To have access to the whole space, one would in fact need to perform exponentially\n",
    "many operations, which is practically intractable to do (Nielsen, 4.5.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this mean that the supposed power of quantum computation is practically inaccessible to us? No. Even though we\n",
    "only reach a very small part of Hilbert space using \"cheap\" ansatzes, the states we do reach might be very useful\n",
    "for solving a particular problem. Moreover, these states might be classically intractable to compute (source to come),\n",
    "meaning the information they represent is not practical to determine using classical computers. They are however efficiently\n",
    "prepared using quantum computers, as the number of quantum operations needed to be applied is by construction only polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can one leverage this in a machine learning setting? A common approach is to use variants of the previous ansatzes to encode features to qubits by performing rotations, thus embedding the data in a high dimensional quantum state. Subsequent parameterized operations on the qubits then applies powerful transformations to the embedded data in a high dimensional space. Such methods are often described as quantum kernel methods, because of their similarity to classical kernel methods in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you will perform quantum machine learning on the two first targets of Scikit learn iris data set. The data can be obtained the following way"

    "  * Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Use canvas to hand in your projects, log in  at  <http://canvas.uio.no> with your normal UiO username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Upload **only** the report file!  For the source code file(s) you have developed please provide us with your link to your github domain.  The report file should include all of your discussions and a list of the codes you have developed.  The full version of the codes should be in your github repository.\n",

    "  * In your github repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Still in your github make a folder where you place your codes.\n",
