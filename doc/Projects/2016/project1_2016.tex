\section*{Introduction to numerical projects}

Here follows a brief recipe and recommendation on how to write a report for each
project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual 
numerical methods you have used.
\item Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient
to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm
in the program itself.

\item Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.
\item If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits
in order to test your program when developing the code.
\item Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to
       label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions
       and labels on the axes.
\item Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision
of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative
discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc. 

\item Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to 
the problems.
\item Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the 
exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and 
other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise.
We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help
us improve it.
\item Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the 
computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages
in your work, especially when you don't properly remember 
what a previous test version 
of your program did. Here you could also record 
the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested
or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.
\end{itemize}



\section*{Format for electronic delivery of report and programs}
%
The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also
use DOC or postscript formats or send the report as an ipython notebook file. 
As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python.
The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use Devilry to hand in your projects, log in  at \url{http://devilry.ifi.uio.no} with your normal UiO username and password
and choose FYS4411.
There you can load up the files within the deadline.
\item Upload {\bf only} the report file!  For the source code file(s) you have developed please provide us with your link to your github domain. 
The report file should include all of your discussions and a list of the codes you have developed. 
Do not include library files which are available at the course homepage, unless you have
made specific changes to them.
\item In your git repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code
for a selected set of runs and input parameters. 
\item In all projects, you should include a discussion of tests and possibly unit testing of your code(s).
\item Comments  from us on your projects, approval or not, corrections to be made 
etc can be found under
your Devilry domain and are only visible to you and the teachers of the course.

\end{itemize}

Finally, 
we encourage you to work two and two together. Optimal working groups consist of 
2-3 students. You can then hand in a common report. 


\section*{Project 1, Variational Monte Carlo studies of bosonic systems, The deadline for project 1 is March 4}

 The spectacular demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in gases of
 alkali atoms $^{87}$Rb, $^{23}$Na, $^7$Li confined in magnetic
 traps has led to an explosion of interest in
 confined Bose systems. Of interest is the fraction of condensed atoms, the
 nature of the condensate, the excitations above the condensate, the atomic
 density in the trap as a function of Temperature and the critical temperature of BEC,
 $T_c$. 

 A key feature of the trapped alkali and atomic hydrogen systems is that they are
 dilute. The characteristic dimensions of a typical trap for $^{87}$Rb is
 $a_{h0}=\left( {\hbar}/{m\omega_\perp}\right)^\frac{1}{2}=1-2 \times 10^4$
 \AA\ . The interaction between $^{87}$Rb atoms can be well represented
 by its s-wave scattering length, $a_{Rb}$. This scattering length lies in the
 range $85 < a_{Rb} < 140 a_0$ where $a_0 = 0.5292$ \AA\ is the Bohr radius.
 The definite value $a_{Rb} = 100 a_0$ is usually selected and
 for calculations the definite ratio of atom size to trap size 
 $a_{Rb}/a_{h0} = 4.33 \times 10^{-3}$ 
 is usually chosen. A typical $^{87}$Rb atom
 density in the trap is $n \simeq 10^{12}- 10^{14}$ atoms/cm$^3$ giving an
 inter-atom spacing $\ell \simeq 10^4$ \AA. Thus the effective atom size is small
 compared to both the trap size and the inter-atom spacing, the condition
 for diluteness ($na^3_{Rb} \simeq 10^{-6}$ where $n = N/V$ is the number
 density). 

Many theoretical studies of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in gases
of alkali atoms confined in magnetic or optical traps have been
conducted in the framework of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation.  The
key point for the validity of this description is the dilute condition
of these systems, that is, the average distance between the atoms is
much larger than the range of the inter-atomic interaction. In this
situation the physics is dominated by two-body collisions, well
described in terms of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$.  The crucial
parameter defining the condition for diluteness is the gas parameter
$x({\bf r})= n({\bf r}) a^3$, where $n({\bf r})$ is the local density
of the system. For low values of the average gas parameter $x_{av}\le
10^{-3}$, the mean field Gross-Pitaevskii equation does an excellent
job.  However,
in recent experiments, the local gas parameter may well exceed this
value due to the possibility of tuning the scattering length in the
presence of a so-called Feshbach resonance.

Thus, improved many-body methods like Monte Carlo calculations may be
needed.  The aim of this project is to use the Variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) method and evaluate the ground state energy of a trapped, hard
sphere Bose gas for different numbers of particles with a specific
trial wave function.

 This trial wave function is used to study the sensitivity of
 condensate and non-condensate properties to the hard sphere radius
 and the number of particles.  The trap we will use is a spherical (S)
 or an elliptical (E) harmonic trap in one, two and finally three
 dimensions, with the latter given by
  \begin{equation}
 V_{ext}({\bf r}) = 
 \Bigg\{
 \begin{array}{ll}
	 \frac{1}{2}m\omega_{ho}^2r^2 & (S)\\
 \strut
	 \frac{1}{2}m[\omega_{ho}^2(x^2+y^2) + \omega_z^2z^2] & (E)
 \label{trap_eqn}
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}
 where (S) stands for symmetric and 
 \begin{equation}
     H = \sum_i^N \left(
	 \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}
	 { \bigtriangledown }_{i}^2 +
	 V_{ext}({\bf{r}}_i)\right)  +
	 \sum_{i<j}^{N} V_{int}({\bf{r}}_i,{\bf{r}}_j),
 \end{equation}
 as the two-body Hamiltonian of the system.  Here $\omega_{ho}^2$
 defines the trap potential strength.  In the case of the elliptical
 trap, $V_{ext}(x,y,z)$, $\omega_{ho}=\omega_{\perp}$ is the trap
 frequency in the perpendicular or $xy$ plane and $\omega_z$ the
 frequency in the $z$ direction.  The mean square vibrational
 amplitude of a single boson at $T=0K$ in the trap (\ref{trap_eqn}) is
 $\langle x^2\rangle=(\hbar/2m\omega_{ho})$ so that $a_{ho} \equiv
 (\hbar/m\omega_{ho})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ defines the characteristic length
 of the trap.  The ratio of the frequencies is denoted
 $\lambda=\omega_z/\omega_{\perp}$ leading to a ratio of the trap
 lengths $(a_{\perp}/a_z)=(\omega_z/\omega_{\perp})^{\frac{1}{2}} =
 \sqrt{\lambda}$.

 We will represent the inter-boson interaction by a pairwise,
 repulsive potential
 \begin{equation}
 V_{int}(|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|) =  \Bigg\{
 \begin{array}{ll}
v	 \infty & {|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|} \leq {a}\\
	 0 & {|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|} > {a}
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}
 where ${a}$ is the so-called hard-core diameter of the bosons.
 Clearly, $V_{int}(|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|)$ is zero if the bosons are
 separated by a distance $|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|$ greater than $a$ but
 infinite if they attempt to come within a distance $|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j| \leq a$.

 Our trial wave function for the ground state with $N$ atoms is given by
 \begin{equation}
 \Psi_T({\bf R})=\Psi_T({\bf r}_1, {\bf r}_2, \dots {\bf r}_N,\alpha,\beta)=\prod_i g(\alpha,\beta,{\bf r}_i)\prod_{i<j}f(a,|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|),
 \label{eq:trialwf}
 \end{equation}
 where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are variational parameters. The
 single-particle wave function is proportional to the harmonic
 oscillator function for the ground state, i.e.,
 \begin{equation}
    g(\alpha,\beta,{\bf r}_i)= \exp{[-\alpha(x_i^2+y_i^2+\beta z_i^2)]}.
 \end{equation}
 For spherical traps we have $\beta = 1$ and for non-interacting
 bosons ($a=0$) we have $\alpha = 1/2a_{ho}^2$.  The correlation wave
 function is
 \begin{equation}
    f(a,|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|)=\Bigg\{
 \begin{array}{ll}
	 0 & {|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|} \leq {a}\\
	 (1-\frac{a}{|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|}) & {|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|} > {a}.
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}  

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[a)] Find analytic expressions for the local energy 
 \begin{equation}
    E_L({\bf R})=\frac{1}{\Psi_T({\bf R})}H\Psi_T({\bf R}),
    \label{eq:locale}
 \end{equation}
 for the above 
 trial wave function of Eq.~(\ref{eq:trialwf}). 
Find first the local energy the case with only the harmonic oscillator potential, that is we set $a=0$.
Use first that $\beta =1$ and find the relevant local energies in one, two and three dimensions for one and
$N$ particles with the same mass. 

 Compute also the analytic expression for the drift force to be used in importance sampling
 \begin{equation}
   F = \frac{2\nabla \Psi_T}{\Psi_T}.
 \end{equation}
Find first the equivalent expressions for the just the harmonic oscillator part in one, two and three dimensions
with $\beta=1$. 

Next, we will find the local energy for the full problem in three dimensions.
The tricky part is to find an analytic expressions for the derivative of the trial wave function 
\[
   \frac{1}{\Psi_T({\bf R})}\sum_i^{N}\nabla_i^2\Psi_T({\bf R}),
\]
with the above 
trial wave function of Eq.~(\ref{eq:trialwf}).
We rewrite (and we can use the same general expressions for projects 2 and 3)
\[
\Psi_T({\bf R})=\Psi_T({\bf r}_1, {\bf r}_2, \dots {\bf r}_N,\alpha,\beta)=\prod_i g(\alpha,\beta,{\bf r}_i)\prod_{i<j}f(a,|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|),
\]
as
\[
\Psi_T({\bf R})=\prod_i g(\alpha,\beta,{\bf r}_i)\exp{\left(\sum_{i<j}u(r_{ij})\right)}
\]
where we have defined $r_{ij}=|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|$
and 
\[
   f(r_{ij})= \exp{\left(\sum_{i<j}u(r_{ij})\right)},
\]
with $u(r_{ij})=\ln{f(r_{ij})}$.
We have also
\[
    g(\alpha,\beta,{\bf r}_i) = \exp{-\alpha(x_i^2+y_i^2+\beta z_i^2)}= \phi({\bf r}_i).
\]

Show that the first  derivative for particle $k$ is
\[
  \nabla_k\Psi_T({\bf R}) = \nabla_k\phi({\bf r}_k)\left[\prod_{i\ne k}\phi({\bf r}_i)\right]\exp{\left(\sum_{i<j}u(r_{ij})\right)}+ 
\prod_i\phi({\bf r}_i)\exp{\left(\sum_{i<j}u(r_{ij})\right)}\sum_{j\ne k}\nabla_k u(r_{ij}),
\]
and find the final expression for our specific trial function.
The expression for the second derivative is (show this)
\[
   \frac{1}{\Psi_T({\bf R})}\nabla_k^2\Psi_T({\bf R})=
   \frac{\nabla_k^2\phi({\bf r}_k)}{\phi({\bf r}_k)}+
\frac{\nabla_k\phi({\bf r}_k)}{\phi({\bf r}_k)}\left(\sum_{j\ne k}\frac{({\bf r}_k-{\bf r}_j)}{r_{kj}}u'(r_{ij})\right)+
\] 
\[
\sum_{ij\ne k}\frac{({\bf r}_k-{\bf r}_i)({\bf r}_k-{\bf r}_j)}{r_{ki}r_{kj}}u'(r_{ki})u'(r_{kj})+
\sum_{j\ne k}\left( u''(r_{kj})+\frac{2}{r_{kj}}u'(r_{kj})\right).
\]
Use this expression to find the final second derivative entering the definition of the local energy. 
You need to get the analytic expression for this expression using the harmonic oscillator wave functions
and the correlation term defined in the project.



 \item[b)] Write a Variational Monte Carlo program which uses standard
   Metropolis sampling and compute the ground state energy of a
   spherical harmonic oscillator ($\beta = 1$) with no interaction and
   one dimension.  Use natural units and make an analysis of your
   calculations using both the analytic expression for the local
   energy and a numerical calculation of the kinetic energy using
   numerical derivation.  Compare the CPU time difference.  The only
   variational parameter is $\alpha$. Perform these calculations for
   $N=1$, $N=10$, $100$ and $500$ atoms. Compare your results with the
   exact answer.  Extend then your results to two and three dimensions
   and compare with the analytical results.

\item[c)] We repeat exercise b), but now we replace the brute force Metropolis algorithm with 
importance sampling based on the Fokker-Planck and the Langevin equations. 
Discuss your results and comment on eventual differences between importance sampling and brute force sampling.
Run the calculations for the one, two and three-dimensional systems only and without the repulsive potential. 
Study the dependence of the results as a function of the time step $\delta t$.  
Compare the results with those obtained under b) and comment eventual differences.

\item[d)] In performing the Monte Carlo analysis you should use
  blocking as a technique to make the statistical analysis of the
  numerical data. Present your results with a proper evaluation of the
  statistical errors. Repeat the calculations from exercise c) and
  include a proper error analysis. Limit yourself to the
  three-dimensional case only.

 \item[e)] We turn now to the elliptic trap with a repulsive
   interaction.  We fix, as in Refs.~[1,2] below,
   $a/a_{ho}=0.0043$. Introduce lengths in units of $a_{ho}$,
   $r\rightarrow r/a_{ho}$ and energy in units of $\hbar\omega_{ho}$.
   Show then that the original Hamiltonian can be rewritten as
 \[ 
    H=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}\left(-\nabla^2_i+x_i^2+y_i^2+\gamma^2z_i^2\right)+\sum_{i<j}V_{int}(|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|).
 \]
 What is the expression for $\gamma$?  Choose the initial value for
 $\beta=\gamma = 2.82843$ and set up a VMC program which computes the
 ground state energy using the trial wave function of
 Eq.~(\ref{eq:trialwf})  using only $\alpha$ as variational
 parameter.  Use standard Metropolis sampling and vary the parameter
 $\alpha$ in order to find a minimum. Perform the calculations for
 $N=10,50$ and $N=100$ and compare your results to those from the
 ideal case in the previous exercises.  In actual calculations
 employing the Metropolis algorithm, all moves are recast into the
 chosen simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions. To carry
 out consistently the Metropolis moves, it has to be assumed that the
 correlation function has a range shorter than $L/2$. Then, to decide
 if a move of a single particle is accepted or not, only the set of
 particles contained in a sphere of radius $L/2$ centered at the
 referred particle have to be considered.  Benchmark your results with
 those of Refs.~[1,2].

\item[f)]  Repeat the previous calculations by varying the energy using the
conjugate gradient method or similar methods to obtain the best possible parameter
$\alpha$. 


\item[g)] With the optimal parameters for the ground state wave
  function, compute again the onebody density with and without the Jastrow
factor.  How important are the correlations induced by the Jastrow factor?

\section*{How to write the report}
What should the report contain and how can I structure it? A typical structure follows here.
\begin{itemize}
\item An abstract with the main findings.
\item  An introduction where you explain the aims and rationale for the physics case and what you have done. At the end of the introduction you should give a brief summary of the structure of the report
\item Theoretical models and technicalities. This sections ends often being the methods section.
\item Results and discussion
\item Conclusions and perspectives
\item Appendix with extra material
\item Bibliography
\end{itemize}
Keep always a good log of what you do.

\subsection*{What should I focus on? Introduction.}
You don't need to answer all questions in a chronological order. When you write the introduction you could focus on the following aspects
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivate the reader, the first part of the introduction gives always a motivation and tries to give the overarching ideas
\item What I have done
\item The structure of the report, how it is organized etc
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{What should I focus on? Methods sections.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the methods and algorithms
\item You need to explain how you implemented the methods and also say something about the structure of your algorithm and present some parts of your code
\item You should plug in some calculations to demonstrate your code, such as selected runs used to validate and verify your results. The latter is extremely important!! A reader needs to understand that your code reproduces selected benchmarks and reproduces previous results, either numerical and/or well-known closed form expressions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What should I focus on? Results sections.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Present your results
\item Give a critical discussion of your work and place it in the correct context.
\item Relate your work to other calculations/studies
\item An eventual reader should be able to reproduce your calculations if she/he wants to do so. All input variables should be properly explained.
\item Make sure that figures and tables contain enough information in their captions, axis labels etc so that an eventual reader can gain a first impression of your work by studying figures and tables only.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What should I focus on? Conclusions sections.}
\begin{itemize}
\item State your main findings and interpretations
\item Try as far as possible to present perspectives for future work
\item Try to discuss the pros and cons of the methods and possible improvements
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What should I focus on? Additional material, appendices.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Additional calculations used to validate the codes
\item Selected calculations, these can be listed with few comments
\item Listing of the code if you feel this is necessary
\item You can consider moving parts of the material from the methods section to the appendix. You can also place additional material on your webpage.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{What should I focus on? References.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Give always references to material you base your work on, either scientific articles/reports or books.
\item Refer to articles as: name(s) of author(s), journal, volume (boldfaced), page and year in parenthesis.
\item Refer to books as: name(s) of author(s), title of book, publisher, place and year, eventual page numbers
\end{itemize}



\section*{Format for electronic delivery of report and programs}
%
Your are free to choose your format for handing in. The simplest way is that you send us your github link that contains the report in your chosen format(pdf, ps, docx, ipython notebook etc) and the programs.
As programming language you have to choose either C++ or Fortran or Python. We recommend C++ or Fortran.
Finally, 
we recommend that you work together. Optimal working groups consist of 
2-3 students, but more people can collaborate. You can then hand in a common report. 



\section*{Unit tests, how and why?}
Unit Testing is the practice of testing the smallest testable parts, called units, of an application individually and independently to determine if they behave exactly as expected. Unit tests (short code fragments) are usually written such that they can be preformed at any time during the development to continually verify the behavior of the code. In this way, possible bugs will be identified early in the development cycle, making the debugging at later stage much easier. There are many benefits associated with Unit Testing, such as
\begin{itemize}
\item It increases confidence in changing and maintaining code. Big changes can be made to the code quickly, since the tests will ensure that everything still is working properly.
\item Since the code needs to be modular to make Unit Testing possible, the code will be easier to reuse. This improves the code design.
\item Debugging is easier, since when a test fails, only the latest changes need to be debugged.
\item Different parts of a project can be tested without the need to wait for the other parts to be available.
\item A unit test can serve as a documentation on the functionality of a unit of the code.
\end{itemize}
Here follows a simple example, see the website of the course for more information on how to install unit test libraries.
\begin{verbatim}
#include <unittest++/UnitTest++.h> 

class MyMultiplyClass{ 
public: 
   double multiply(double x, double y) { 
      return x * y; 
   } 
}; 
TEST(MyMath) { 
     MyMultiplyClass my; CHECK_EQUAL(56, my.multiply(7,8)); 
} 
int main() 
{ 
return UnitTest::RunAllTests(); 
}
\end{verbatim}
For Fortran users, the link at \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit/} contains a similar software for unit testing.
