    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " The spectacular demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in gases of\n",
    " alkali atoms $^{87}$Rb, $^{23}$Na, $^7$Li confined in magnetic\n",
    " traps has led to an explosion of interest in\n",
    " confined Bose systems. Of interest is the fraction of condensed atoms, the\n",
    " nature of the condensate, the excitations above the condensate, the atomic\n",
    " density in the trap as a function of Temperature and the critical temperature of BEC,\n",
    " $T_c$. \n",
    "\n",
    " A key feature of the trapped alkali and atomic hydrogen systems is that they are\n",
    " dilute. The characteristic dimensions of a typical trap for $^{87}$Rb is\n",
    " $a_{h0}=\\left( {\\hbar}/{m\\omega_\\perp}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}=1-2 \\times 10^4$\n",
    " \\AA\\ . The interaction between $^{87}$Rb atoms can be well represented\n",
    " by its s-wave scattering length, $a_{Rb}$. This scattering length lies in the\n",
    " range $85 a_0 < a_{Rb} < 140 a_0$ where $a_0 = 0.5292$ \\AA\\ is the Bohr radius.\n",
    " The definite value $a_{Rb} = 100 a_0$ is usually selected and\n",
    " for calculations the definite ratio of atom size to trap size \n",
    " $a_{Rb}/a_{h0} = 4.33 \\times 10^{-3}$ \n",
    " is usually chosen. A typical $^{87}$Rb atom\n",
    " density in the trap is $n \\simeq 10^{12}- 10^{14}$ atoms per cubic cm, giving an\n",
    " inter-atom spacing $\\ell \\simeq 10^4$ \\AA. Thus the effective atom size is small\n",
    " compared to both the trap size and the inter-atom spacing, the condition\n",
    " for diluteness ($na^3_{Rb} \\simeq 10^{-6}$ where $n = N/V$ is the number\n",
    " density). \n",
    "\n",
    "Many theoretical studies of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in gases\n",
    "of alkali atoms confined in magnetic or optical traps have been\n",
    "conducted in the framework of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation.  The\n",
    "key point for the validity of this description is the dilute condition\n",
    "of these systems, that is, the average distance between the atoms is\n",
    "much larger than the range of the inter-atomic interaction. In this\n",
    "situation the physics is dominated by two-body collisions, well\n",
    "described in terms of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$.  The crucial\n",
    "parameter defining the condition for diluteness is the gas parameter\n",
    "$x(\\mathbf{r})= n(\\mathbf{r}) a^3$, where $n(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local density\n",
    "of the system. For low values of the average gas parameter $x_{av}\\le 10^{-3}$, the mean field Gross-Pitaevskii equation does an excellent\n",
    "job.  However,\n",
    "in recent experiments, the local gas parameter may well exceed this\n",
    "value due to the possibility of tuning the scattering length in the\n",
    "presence of a so-called Feshbach resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, improved many-body methods like Monte Carlo calculations may be\n",
    "needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to use the Variational Monte Carlo\n",
    "(VMC) method and evaluate the ground state energy of a trapped, hard\n",
    "sphere Bose gas for different numbers of particles with a specific\n",
    "trial wave function.\n",
    "\n",
    " This trial wave function is used to study the sensitivity of\n",
    " condensate and non-condensate properties to the hard sphere radius\n",
    " and the number of particles.  The trap we will use is a spherical (S)\n",
    " or an elliptical (E) harmonic trap in one, two and finally three\n",
    " dimensions, with the latter given by"

    "  * Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual  numerical methods you have used.\n",

    "  * Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning."
