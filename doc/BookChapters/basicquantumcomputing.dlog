*** error: file has a mako construction ${\ensuremath{|0\rangle}'
    but seemingly no definition in <%...%>'
    (it is not a command-line given mako variable either).
    However, if this is a variable in a Makefile or Bash script
    run with --no_mako - and you cannot use mako and Makefile or Bash variables
    in the same document!
