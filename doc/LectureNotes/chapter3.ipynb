    "# Basic Steps of Scientific Investigations\n",
    "\n",
    "An overarching aim in this course is to give you a deeper\n",
    "understanding of the scientific method. The problems we study will all\n",
    "involve cases where we can apply classical mechanics. In our previous\n",
    "material we already assumed that we had a model for the motion of an\n",
    "object.  Alternatively we could have data from experiment (like Usain\n",
    "Bolt's 100m world record run in 2008).  Or we could have performed\n",
    "ourselves an experiment and we want to understand which forces are at\n",
    "play and whether these forces can be understood in terms of\n",
    "fundamental forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step consists in identifying the problem. What we sketch\n",
    "here may include a mix of experiment and theoretical simulations, or\n",
    "just experiment or only theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying our System\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can ask questions like\n",
    "1. What kind of object is moving\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What kind of data do we have\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do we measure position, velocity, acceleration etc\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which initial conditions influence our system\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Other aspects which allow us to identify the system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "With our eventual data and observations we would now like to develop a\n",
    "model for the system. In the end we want obviously to be able to\n",
    "understand which forces are at play and how they influence our\n",
    "specific system. That is, can we extract some deeper insights about a\n",
    "system?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need then to\n",
    "1. Find the forces that act on our system\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduce models for the forces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify the equations which can govern the system (Newton's second law for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. More elements we deem important for defining our model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving the Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "With the model at hand, we can then solve the equations. In classical mechanics we normally end up  with solving sets of coupled ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations.\n",
    "1. Using Newton's second law we have equations of the type $\\boldsymbol{F}=m\\boldsymbol{a}=md\\boldsymbol{v}/dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We need to  define the initial conditions (typically the initial velocity and position as functions of time) and/or initial conditions and boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The solution of the equations give us then the position, the velocity and other time-dependent quantities which may specify the motion of a given object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not yet done. With our lovely solvers, we need to start thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to ask the big questions. What do our results mean? Can we give a simple interpretation in terms of fundamental laws?  What do our results mean? Are they correct?\n",
    "Thus, typical questions we may ask are\n",
    "1. Are our results for say $\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$ valid?  Do we trust what we did?  Can you validate and verify the correctness of your results?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluate the answers and their implications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare with experimental data if possible. Does our model make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. and obviously many other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis stage feeds back to the first stage. It may happen that\n",
    "the data we had were not good enough, there could be large statistical\n",
    "uncertainties. We may need to collect more data or perhaps we did a\n",
    "sloppy job in identifying the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these steps are essential elements in a scientific\n",
    "enquiry. Hopefully, through a mix of numerical simulations, analytical\n",
    "calculations and experiments we may gain a deeper insight about the\n",
    "physics of a specific system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now remind ourselves of Newton's laws, since these are the laws of motion we will study in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Newton's Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing a physical system we normally start with distinguishing between the object we are studying (we will label this in more general terms as our **system**) and how this system interacts with the environment (which often means everything else!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our investigations we will thus analyze a specific physics problem in terms of the system and the environment.\n",
    "In doing so we need to identify the forces that act on the system and assume that the\n",
    "forces acting on the system must have a source, an identifiable cause in\n",
    "the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A force acting on for example a falling object must be related to an interaction with something in the environment.\n",
    "This also means that we do not consider internal forces. The latter are forces between\n",
    "one part of the object and another part. In this course we will mainly focus on external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact forces, as evident from the name, are forces that occur at the contact between\n",
    "the system and the environment. Well-known long-range forces are the gravitional force and the electromagnetic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a model for forces acting on an object\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set up the forces which act on an object, the following steps may be useful\n",
    "1. Divide the problem into system and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Draw a closed curve around the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Give names and symbols to all the contact forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identify the long-range forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Make a drawing of the object. Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, starting from where the force is acting. The direction of the vector(s) indicates the (positive) direction of the force. Try to make the length of the arrow indicate the relative magnitude of the forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Draw in the axes of the coordinate system. It is often convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion. When you choose the direction of the axis you also choose the positive direction for the axis.\n",
