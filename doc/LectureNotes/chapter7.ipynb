    "\n",
    "Let us quickly remind ourselves about the definition of a so-called **inertial frame of reference**.\n",
    "An inertial frame of reference in classical physics (and in special\n",
    "relativity as well) possesses the property that in this frame of reference a\n",
    "body with zero net force acting upon it does not accelerate; that is,\n",
    "such a body is at rest or moving at a constant velocity.  If we recall the definition of Newton's first law, this is essentially its description.\n",
    "\n",
    "An\n",
    "inertial frame of reference can be defined in analytical terms as a\n",
    "frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously,\n",
    "isotropically, and in a time-independent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the\n",
    "physics of a system in an inertial frame has no causes external to\n",
    "the system. An inertial frame of reference may also be called an\n",
    "inertial reference frame, inertial frame, Galilean reference frame, or\n",
    "inertial space. \n",
    "\n",
    "All inertial frames are in a state of constant, rectilinear motion\n",
    "with respect to one another; an accelerometer moving with any of them\n",
    "would detect zero acceleration. Measurements in one inertial frame can\n",
    "be converted to measurements in another by a simple transformation\n",
    "(the Galilean transformation in Newtonian physics and the Lorentz\n",
    "transformation in special relativity).\n",
    "In general relativity, in any\n",
    "region small enough for the curvature of spacetime and tidal forces\n",
    "to be negligible, one can find a set of inertial frames that\n",
    "approximately describe that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a non-inertial reference frame in classical physics and special\n",
    "relativity, the physics of a system vary depending on the acceleration\n",
    "of that frame with respect to an inertial frame, and the usual\n",
    "physical forces must be supplemented by fictitious forces. In\n",
    "contrast, systems in general relativity don't have external causes,\n",
    "because of the principle of geodesic motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical physics, for example, a ball dropped towards the ground\n",
    "does not go exactly straight down because the Earth is rotating, which\n",
    "means the frame of reference of an observer on Earth is not\n",
    "inertial. The physics must account for the Coriolis effect—in this\n",
    "case thought of as a force—to predict the horizontal motion. Another\n",
    "example of such a fictitious force associated with rotating reference\n",
    "frames is the centrifugal effect, or centrifugal force. We will here,\n",
