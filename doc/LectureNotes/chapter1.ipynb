    "Classical mechanics is a topic which has been taught intensively over\n",
    "several centuries. It is, with its many variants and ways of\n",
    "presenting the educational material, normally the first **real** physics\n",
    "course many of us meet and it lays the foundation for further physics\n",
    "studies. Many of the equations and ways of reasoning about the\n",
    "underlying laws of motion and pertinent forces, shape our approaches and understanding\n",
    "of the scientific method and discourse, as well as the way we develop our insights\n",
    "and deeper understanding about physical systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a wealth of\n",
    "well-tested (from both a physics point of view and a pedagogical\n",
    "standpoint) exercises and problems which can be solved\n",
    "analytically. However, many of these problems represent idealized and\n",
    "less realistic situations.  The large majority of these problems are\n",
    "solved by paper and pencil and are traditionally aimed\n",
    "at what we normally refer to as continuous models from which we may find an analytical solution.  As a consequence,\n",
    "when teaching mechanics, it implies that we can seldomly venture beyond an idealized case\n",
    "in order to develop our understandings and insights about the\n",
    "underlying forces and laws of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, numerical algorithms call for approximate discrete\n",
    "models and much of the development of methods for continuous models\n",
    "are nowadays being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and\n",
    "industry, simply because **much larger classes of problems can be addressed** with discrete models, often  by simpler and more\n",
    "generic methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see below, when properly scaling the equations at hand,\n",
    "discrete models open up for more advanced abstractions and the possibility to\n",
    "study  real life systems, with the added bonus that we can explore and\n",
    "deepen our basic understanding of various physical systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical solutions are as important as before. In addition, such\n",
    "solutions provide us with invaluable benchmarks and tests for our\n",
    "discrete models. Such benchmarks, as we will see below, allow us \n",
    "to discuss possible sources of errors and their behaviors.  And\n",
    "finally, since most of our models are based on various algorithms from\n",
    "numerical mathematics, we have a unique oppotunity to gain a deeper\n",
    "understanding of the mathematical approaches we are using.\n",

    "With computing and data science as important elements in essentially\n",

    "symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical\n",
    "paper and pencil solutions**. \n",
    "Computing provides us with the tools to develope our own understanding of the scientific method by enhancing algorithmic thinking.\n",

    "The way we will teach this course reflects\n",

    "hope is that this will allow you to explore the physics of systems\n",
    "governed by the degrees of freedom of classical mechanics at a deeper\n",
    "level, and that these insights about the scientific method will help\n",
    "you to develop a better understanding of how the underlying forces and\n",
    "equations of motion and how they impact a given system. Furthermore, by introducing various numerical methods\n",

    "The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem\n",
    "as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying\n",
    "general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a\n",
    "general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of\n",
    "computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or\n",
    "numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This\n",
