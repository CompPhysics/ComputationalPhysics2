    "Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ and how it varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\\boldsymbol{x} =[x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_{n-1}]^T$. \n",
    "The first variable is called the **dependent**, the **outcome** or the **response** variable while the set of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $\\boldsymbol{y}$ with a given $\\boldsymbol{x}$. The estimation of  $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$ is made using a data set with \n",
    "* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",

    "* Response (target, dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",

    "\n",
    " The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions, making fits and many other things.\n",

    "$\\boldsymbol{X}$ through a functional relationship like $y_i =\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{X}_{i,\\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of\n",

These data are functions of a series of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}=[x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. \n",

    "Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern\n",
    "statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training\n",
    "set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to\n",
    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",
    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,\n",
    "1. The **bootstrap method**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. and **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition there are several other methods such as the Jackknife and the Blocking methods. We will discuss in particular\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap method.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they\n",
    "involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using\n",
    "different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent\n",
    "advances in computing power, the computational requirements of\n",
    "resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we\n",
    "discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools\n",
    "in the practical application of many statistical learning\n",
    "procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the\n",
    "test error associated with a given statistical learning method in\n",
    "order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level\n",
    "of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model’s performance is\n",
    "known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper\n",
