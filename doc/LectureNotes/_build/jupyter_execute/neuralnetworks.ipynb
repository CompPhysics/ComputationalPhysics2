    "Artificial neural networks are computational systems that can learn to\n",
    "perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being\n",
    "programmed with any task-specific rules. It is supposed to mimic a\n",
    "biological system, wherein neurons interact by sending signals in the\n",
    "form of mathematical functions between layers. All layers can contain\n",
    "an arbitrary number of neurons, and each connection is represented by\n",
    "a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of artificial neural networks has a long history of\n",
    "development, and is closely connected with the advancement of computer\n",
    "science and computers in general. A model of artificial neurons was\n",
    "first developed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 to study signal\n",
    "processing in the brain and has later been refined by others. The\n",
    "general idea is to mimic neural networks in the human brain, which is\n",
    "composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other by\n",
    "sending electrical signals.  Each neuron accumulates its incoming\n",
    "signals, which must exceed an activation threshold to yield an\n",
    "output. If the threshold is not overcome, the neuron remains inactive,\n",
    "i.e. has zero output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour has inspired a simple mathematical model for an artificial neuron."

    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",
    "consists of layers of connected neurons, or nodes or units.  We will\n",
    "refer to these interchangeably as units or nodes, and sometimes as\n",

    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",
    "each neuron can be approximated mathematically as a convolution\n",
    "operation.  (figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks emulate the behaviour of neurons in the\n",
    "visual cortex by enforcing a *local* connectivity pattern between\n",
    "nodes of adjacent layers: Each node in a convolutional layer is\n",
    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One uses often so-called fully-connected feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "with three or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers\n",
    "and an output layer) consisting of neurons that have non-linear\n",
    "activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such networks are often called *multilayer perceptrons* (MLPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward\n",
    "neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite\n",
    "number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional\n",
    "function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for\n",
    "the hidden layer is a **non-constant, bounded and\n",
    "monotonically-increasing continuous function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to\n",
    "the hidden layer, the output nodes are always assumed to be linear, so\n",

    "1. A neural network with one or more layers of nodes between the input and the output nodes.\n",

    "2. The multilayer network structure, or architecture, or topology, consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer.\n",

    "3. The input nodes pass values to the first hidden layer, its nodes pass the information on to the second and so on till we reach the output layer.\n",

    "### Define model and architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simple feed-forward neural network will consist of an *input* layer, a single *hidden* layer and an *output* layer. The activation $y$ of each neuron is a weighted sum of inputs, passed through an activation function. In case of the simple perceptron model we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i a_i ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = f(z) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is the activation function, $a_i$ represents input from neuron $i$ in the preceding layer\n",
    "and $w_i$ is the weight to input $i$.  \n",
    "The activation of the neurons in the input layer is just the features (e.g. a pixel value).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest activation function for a neuron is the *Heaviside* function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(z) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,  &  z > 0\\\\\n",
    "0,  & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A feed-forward neural network with this activation is known as a *perceptron*.  \n",
    "For a binary classifier (i.e. two classes, 0 or 1, dog or not-dog) we can also use this in our output layer.  \n",
    "This activation can be generalized to $k$ classes (using e.g. the *one-against-all* strategy), \n",
    "and we call these architectures *multiclass perceptrons*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is now common to use the terms Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) (1 hidden layer) and  \n",
    "Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (2 or more hidden layers) to refer to feed-forward neural networks with any activation function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical choices for activation functions include the sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent, and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).  \n",
    "We will be using the sigmoid function $\\sigma(x)$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} ,$$\n",

    "which is inspired by probability theory (see logistic regression) and was most commonly used until about 2011. See the discussion below concerning other activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input \n",
    "\n",
    "Since each input image has 8x8 = 64 pixels or features, we have an input layer of 64 neurons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hidden layer\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Output\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were building a binary classifier, it would be sufficient with a single neuron in the output layer,\n",
    "which could output 0 or 1 according to the Heaviside function. This would be an example of a *hard* classifier, meaning it outputs the class of the input directly. However, if we are dealing with noisy data it is often beneficial to use a *soft* classifier, which outputs the probability of being in class 0 or 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a soft binary classifier, we could use a single neuron and interpret the output as either being the probability of being in class 0 or the probability of being in class 1. Alternatively we could use 2 neurons, and interpret each neuron as the probability of being in each class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are doing multiclass classification, with 10 categories, it is natural to use 10 neurons in the output layer. We number the neurons $j = 0,1,...,9$. The activation of each output neuron $j$ will be according to the *softmax* function:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{class $j$} \\mid \\text{input $\\hat{a}$}) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\hat{a}^T \\hat{w}_j)}}\n",
    "{\\sum_{c=0}^{9} \\exp{(\\hat{a}^T \\hat{w}_c)}} ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. each neuron $j$ outputs the probability of being in class $j$ given an input from the hidden layer $\\hat{a}$, with $\\hat{w}_j$ the weights of neuron $j$ to the inputs.  \n",
    "The denominator is a normalization factor to ensure the outputs (probabilities) sum up to 1.  \n",
    "The exponent is just the weighted sum of inputs as before:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_ {ij} a_i+b_j.$$  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weights and biases\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically weights are initialized with small values distributed around zero, drawn from a uniform\n",
    "or normal distribution. Setting all weights to zero means all neurons give the same output, making the network useless.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a bias value to the weighted sum of inputs allows the neural network to represent a greater range\n",
    "of values. Without it, any input with the value 0 will be mapped to zero (before being passed through the activation). The bias unit has an output of 1, and a weight to each neuron $j$, $b_j$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_ {ij} a_i + b_j.$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bias weights $\\hat{b}$ are often initialized to zero, but a small value like $0.01$ ensures all neurons have some output which can be backpropagated in the first training cycle."

    "### Choose cost function and optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how well our neural network is doing we need to introduce a cost function.  \n",
    "We will call the function that gives the error of a single sample output the *loss* function, and the function\n",
    "that gives the total error of our network across all samples the *cost* function.\n",
    "A typical choice for multiclass classification is the *cross-entropy* loss, also known as the negative log likelihood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In *multiclass* classification it is common to treat each integer label as a so called *one-hot* vector:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 5 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. a binary bit string of length $C$, where $C = 10$ is the number of classes in the MNIST dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{ic}$ denote the $c$-th component of the $i$-th one-hot vector.  \n",
    "We define the cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ as a sum over the cross-entropy loss for each point $\\hat{x}_i$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the one-hot representation only one of the terms in the loss function is non-zero, namely the\n",
    "probability of the correct category $c'$  \n",
    "(i.e. the category $c'$ such that $y_{ic'} = 1$). This means that the cross entropy loss only punishes you for how wrong\n",
    "you got the correct label. The probability of category $c$ is given by the softmax function. The vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ represents the parameters of our network, i.e. all the weights and biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by finding the weights and biases that minimize the cost function. One of the most widely used classes of methods is *gradient descent* and its generalizations. The idea behind gradient descent\n",
    "is simply to adjust the weights in the direction where the gradient of the cost function is large and negative. This ensures we flow toward a *local* minimum of the cost function.  \n",
    "Each parameter $\\theta$ is iteratively adjusted according to the rule  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta_i) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is known as the *learning rate*, which controls how big a step we take towards the minimum.  \n",
    "This update can be repeated for any number of iterations, or until we are satisfied with the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective improvement is a variant called *Batch Gradient Descent*.  \n",
    "Instead of calculating the gradient on the whole dataset, we calculate an approximation of the gradient\n",
    "on a subset of the data called a *minibatch*.  \n",
    "If there are $N$ data points and we have a minibatch size of $M$, the total number of batches\n",
    "is $N/M$.  \n",
    "We denote each minibatch $B_k$, with $k = 1, 2,...,N/M$. The gradient then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i \\in B_k} \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. instead of averaging the loss over the entire dataset, we average over a minibatch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has two important benefits:  \n",
    "1. Introducing stochasticity decreases the chance that the algorithm becomes stuck in a local minima.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It significantly speeds up the calculation, since we do not have to use the entire dataset to calculate the gradient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The various optmization  methods, with codes and algorithms,  are discussed in our lectures on [Gradient descent approaches](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to add an extra term to the cost function, proportional\n",
    "to the size of the weights.  This is equivalent to constraining the\n",
    "size of the weights, so that they do not grow out of control.\n",
    "Constraining the size of the weights means that the weights cannot\n",
    "grow arbitrarily large to fit the training data, and in this way\n",
    "reduces *overfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the size of the weights using the so called *L2-norm*, meaning our cost function becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) + \\lambda \\lvert \\lvert \\hat{w} \\rvert \\rvert_2^2 \n",
    "= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) + \\lambda \\sum_{ij} w_{ij}^2,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. we sum up all the weights squared. The factor $\\lambda$ is known as a regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model, we need to calculate the derivative of\n",
    "the cost function with respect to every bias and weight in the\n",
    "network.  In total our network has $(64 + 1)\\times 50=3250$ weights in\n",
    "the hidden layer and $(50 + 1)\\times 10=510$ weights to the output\n",
    "layer ($+1$ for the bias), and the gradient must be calculated for\n",
    "every parameter.  We use the *backpropagation* algorithm discussed\n",
    "above. This is a clever use of the chain rule that allows us to\n",
    "calculate the gradient efficently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix  multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To more efficently train our network these equations are implemented using matrix operations.  \n",
    "The error in the output layer is calculated simply as, with $\\hat{t}$ being our targets,  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta_L = \\hat{t} - \\hat{y} = (n_{inputs}, n_{categories}) .$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient for the output weights is calculated as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla W_{L} = \\hat{a}^T \\delta_L   = (n_{hidden}, n_{categories}) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{a} = (n_{inputs}, n_{hidden})$. This simply means that we are summing up the gradients for each input.  \n",
    "Since we are going backwards we have to transpose the activation matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient with respect to the output bias is then  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\hat{b}_{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{inputs}} \\delta_L = (n_{categories}) .$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The error in the hidden layer is  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta_h = \\delta_L W_{L}^T \\circ f'(z_{h}) = \\delta_L W_{L}^T \\circ a_{h} \\circ (1 - a_{h}) = (n_{inputs}, n_{hidden}) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $f'(a_{h})$ is the derivative of the activation in the hidden layer. The matrix products mean\n",
    "that we are summing up the products for each neuron in the output layer. The symbol $\\circ$ denotes\n",
    "the *Hadamard product*, meaning element-wise multiplication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This again gives us the gradients in the hidden layer:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla W_{h} = X^T \\delta_h = (n_{features}, n_{hidden}) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",

    "### Hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and it will work just fine.\n",
    "For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a\n",
    "few hundred neurons.\n",
    "You can reach for this data set above 98% accuracy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of\n",
    "neurons, in roughly the same amount of training time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex problems, you can gradually\n",
    "ramp up the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very complex tasks, such\n",
    "as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers\n",
    "and they need a huge amount\n",
    "of training data. However, you will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more\n",

    "### Which activation function should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Back propagation algorithm we derived above works by going from\n",
    "the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on\n",
    "the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost\n",
    "function with regards to each parameter in the network, it uses these\n",
    "gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as the\n",
    "algorithm progresses down to the first hidden layers. As a result, the\n",
    "GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights\n",
    "virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\n",
    "solution. This is known in the literature as \n",
    "**the vanishing gradients problem**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can grow bigger and\n",
    "bigger. The result is that many of the layers get large updates of the \n",
    "weights the\n",
    "algorithm diverges. This is the **exploding gradients problem**, which is\n",
    "mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep\n",

    "### Is the Logistic activation function (Sigmoid)  our choice?\n",

    "quite a while (it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were\n",
    "mostly abandoned for a long time), it is only around 2010 that\n",
    "significant progress was made in understanding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper titled [Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep\n",
    "Feedforward Neural Networks by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html) found that\n",
    "the problems with the popular logistic\n",
    "sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique\n",

    "a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of\n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "They showed that with this activation function and this\n",
    "initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is\n",
    "much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the\n",
    "network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the\n",
    "activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made\n",
    "worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0\n",
    "(the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly\n",
    "better than the logistic function in deep networks).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### The derivative of the Logistic funtion\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the logistic activation function, when inputs become large\n",
    "(negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a\n",
    "derivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in,\n",
    "it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network,\n",
    "and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as\n",

    "really nothing left for the lower layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly\n",
    "alleviate this problem. We need the signal to flow properly in both\n",
    "directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in\n",
    "the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want\n",
    "the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For\n",
    "the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the\n",
    "variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of\n",
    "its inputs, and we also need the gradients to have equal variance\n",
    "before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that\n",
    "the vanishing/exploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor\n",
    "choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that\n",
    "if Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in\n",
    "biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out\n",
    "that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural\n",

    "\n",

    "layer, simply zero-centering and normalizing the inputs, then scaling and shifting the result using two new\n",
    "parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other for shifting). In other words, this operation lets the model\n",
    "learn the optimal scale and mean of the inputs for each layer.\n",
    "In order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the inputs’ mean and\n",
    "standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of the inputs over the current\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons but\n",
    "excluding the output neurons) has a probability $p$ of being temporarily dropped out, meaning it will be\n",
    "entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",

    "The first thing we would like to do is divide the data into two or three\n",
    "parts. A training set, a validation or dev (development) set, and a\n",
    "test set. The test set is the data on which we want to make\n",
    "predictions. The dev set is a subset of the training data we use to\n",
    "check how well we are doing out-of-sample, after training the model on\n",
    "the training dataset. We use the validation error as a proxy for the\n",
    "test error in order to make tweaks to our model. It is crucial that we\n",

    "However, sometimes\n",
    "the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for\n",

    "because it is cheaper to collect data in one way versus another. In\n",
    "this case, there can be a mismatch between the training and test\n",
    "data. This can lead to the neural network overfitting these small\n",
    "differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance\n",
    "on the test set despite having a good performance on the validation\n",
    "set. To rectify this, Andrew Ng suggests making two validation or dev\n",
    "sets, one constructed from the training data and one constructed from\n",
    "the test data. The difference between the performance of the algorithm\n",
    "on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This\n",
    "can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for\n",
    "supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",

    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",

    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems."
