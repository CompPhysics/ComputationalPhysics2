<h1><span class="section-number">2. </span>Basic Steps of Scientific Investigations<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-steps-of-scientific-investigations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>An overarching aim in this course is to give you a deeper
understanding of the scientific method. The problems we study will all
involve cases where we can apply classical mechanics. In our previous
material we already assumed that we had a model for the motion of an
object.  Alternatively we could have data from experiment (like Usain
Bolt’s 100m world record run in 2008).  Or we could have performed
ourselves an experiment and we want to understand which forces are at
play and whether these forces can be understood in terms of
fundamental forces.</p>
<p>Our first step consists in identifying the problem. What we sketch
here may include a mix of experiment and theoretical simulations, or
just experiment or only theory.</p>
<div class="section" id="identifying-our-system">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>Identifying our System<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-our-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here we can ask questions like</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>What kind of object is moving</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of data do we have</p></li>
<li><p>How do we measure position, velocity, acceleration etc</p></li>
<li><p>Which initial conditions influence our system</p></li>
<li><p>Other aspects which allow us to identify the system</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-a-model">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>Defining a Model<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-a-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With our eventual data and observations we would now like to develop a
model for the system. In the end we want obviously to be able to
understand which forces are at play and how they influence our
specific system. That is, can we extract some deeper insights about a
system?</p>
<p>We need then to</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Find the forces that act on our system</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce models for the forces</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the equations which can govern the system (Newton’s second law for example)</p></li>
<li><p>More elements we deem important for defining our model</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="solving-the-equations">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>Solving the Equations<a class="headerlink" href="#solving-the-equations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the model at hand, we can then solve the equations. In classical mechanics we normally end up  with solving sets of coupled ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Using Newton’s second law we have equations of the type <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{F}=m\boldsymbol{a}=md\boldsymbol{v}/dt\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We need to  define the initial conditions (typically the initial velocity and position as functions of time) and/or initial conditions and boundary conditions</p></li>
<li><p>The solution of the equations give us then the position, the velocity and other time-dependent quantities which may specify the motion of a given object.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are not yet done. With our lovely solvers, we need to start thinking.</p>
<p>Now it is time to ask the big questions. What do our results mean? Can we give a simple interpretation in terms of fundamental laws?  What do our results mean? Are they correct?
Thus, typical questions we may ask are</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Are our results for say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{r}(t)\)</span> valid?  Do we trust what we did?  Can you validate and verify the correctness of your results?</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the answers and their implications</p></li>
<li><p>Compare with experimental data if possible. Does our model make sense?</p></li>
<li><p>and obviously many other questions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis stage feeds back to the first stage. It may happen that
the data we had were not good enough, there could be large statistical
uncertainties. We may need to collect more data or perhaps we did a
sloppy job in identifying the degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>All these steps are essential elements in a scientific
enquiry. Hopefully, through a mix of numerical simulations, analytical
calculations and experiments we may gain a deeper insight about the
physics of a specific system.</p>
<p>Let us now remind ourselves of Newton’s laws, since these are the laws of motion we will study in this course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="newton-s-laws">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.4. </span>Newton’s Laws<a class="headerlink" href="#newton-s-laws" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When analyzing a physical system we normally start with distinguishing between the object we are studying (we will label this in more general terms as our <strong>system</strong>) and how this system interacts with the environment (which often means everything else!)</p>
<p>In our investigations we will thus analyze a specific physics problem in terms of the system and the environment.
In doing so we need to identify the forces that act on the system and assume that the
forces acting on the system must have a source, an identifiable cause in
the environment.</p>
<p>A force acting on for example a falling object must be related to an interaction with something in the environment.
This also means that we do not consider internal forces. The latter are forces between
one part of the object and another part. In this course we will mainly focus on external forces.</p>
<p>Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces.</p>
<p>Contact forces, as evident from the name, are forces that occur at the contact between
the system and the environment. Well-known long-range forces are the gravitional force and the electromagnetic force.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-a-model-for-forces-acting-on-an-object">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.5. </span>Setting up a model for forces acting on an object<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-model-for-forces-acting-on-an-object" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to set up the forces which act on an object, the following steps may be useful</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Divide the problem into system and environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a closed curve around the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act.</p></li>
<li><p>Give names and symbols to all the contact forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the long-range forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a drawing of the object. Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, starting from where the force is acting. The direction of the vector(s) indicates the (positive) direction of the force. Try to make the length of the arrow indicate the relative magnitude of the forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw in the axes of the coordinate system. It is often convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion. When you choose the direction of the axis you also choose the positive direction for the axis.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="newton-s-laws-the-second-one-first">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.6. </span>Newton’s Laws, the Second one first<a class="headerlink" href="#newton-s-laws-the-second-one-first" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Newton’s second law of motion: The force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{F}\)</span> on an object of inertial mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>
is related to the acceleration a of the object through</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\boldsymbol{F} = m\boldsymbol{a},
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{a}\)</span> is the acceleration.</p>
<p>Newton’s laws of motion are laws of nature that have been found by experimental
investigations and have been shown to hold up to continued experimental investigations.
Newton’s laws are valid over a wide range of length- and time-scales. We
use Newton’s laws of motion to describe everything from the motion of atoms to the
motion of galaxies.</p>
<p>The second law is a vector equation with the acceleration having the same
direction as the force. The acceleration is proportional to the force via the mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> of the system under study.</p>
<p>Newton’s second law introduces a new property of an object, the so-called
inertial mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>. We determine the inertial mass of an object by measuring the
acceleration for a given applied force.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="then-the-first-law">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.7. </span>Then the First Law<a class="headerlink" href="#then-the-first-law" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What happens if the net external force on a body is zero? Applying Newton’s second
law, we find:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\boldsymbol{F} = 0 = m\boldsymbol{a},
\]</div>
<p>which gives using the definition of the acceleration</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\boldsymbol{a} = \frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}=0.
\]</div>
<p>The acceleration is zero, which means that the velocity of the object is constant. This
is often referred to as Newton’s first law. An object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in
that state unless an external force changes its state of motion.
Why do we need a separate law for this? Is it not simply a special case of Newton’s
second law? Yes, Newton’s first law can be deduced from the second law as we have
illustrated. However, the first law is often used for a different purpose: Newton’s
First Law tells us about the limit of applicability of Newton’s Second law. Newton’s
Second law can only be used in reference systems where the First law is obeyed. But
is not the First law always valid? No! The First law is only valid in reference systems
that are not accelerated. If you observe the motion of a ball from an accelerating
car, the ball will appear to accelerate even if there are no forces acting on it. We call
systems that are not accelerating inertial systems, and Newton’s first law is often
called the law of inertia. Newton’s first and second laws of motion are only valid in
inertial systems.</p>
<p>A system is an inertial system if it is not accelerated. It means that the reference system
must not be accelerating linearly or rotating. Unfortunately, this means that most
systems we know are not really inertial systems. For example, the surface of the
Earth is clearly not an inertial system, because the Earth is rotating. The Earth is also
not an inertial system, because it ismoving in a curved path around the Sun. However,
even if the surface of the Earth is not strictly an inertial system, it may be considered

<p>Air resistance tends to scale as the square of the velocity. This is
in contrast to many problems chosen for textbooks, where it is linear
in the velocity. The choice of a linear dependence is motivated by
mathematical simplicity (it keeps the differential equation linear)
rather than by physics. One can see that the force should be quadratic
in velocity by considering the momentum imparted on the air
molecules. If an object sweeps through a volume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dV\)</span> of air in time

<p>On more general terms,
for many systems, e.g. an automobile, there are multiple sources of
resistance. In addition to wind resistance, where the force is
proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v^2\)</span>, there are dissipative effects of the tires on
the pavement, and in the axel and drive train. These other forces can
have components that scale proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>, and components that
are independent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>. Those independent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>, e.g. the usual
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=\mu_K N\)</span> frictional force you consider in your first Physics courses, only set in
once the object is actually moving. As speeds become higher, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v^2\)</span>
components begin to dominate relative to the others. For automobiles
at freeway speeds, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v^2\)</span> terms are largely responsible for the
loss of efficiency. To travel a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> at fixed speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>, the
energy/work required to overcome the dissipative forces are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(fL\)</span>,

<p>For <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=0\)</span> the work is

<p>The differential equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_y\)</span> is a bit more complicated due to

most differential equations, solutions are not “solved”. Instead,
one guesses at a form, then shows the guess is correct. For these

i.e. one with no arbitrary constants. This is called the {\it
particular} solution, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_p(t)\)</span>, though it should really be called

<p>is constant. This is because the force is perpendicular to the
velocity, so that in any differential time element <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span> the work done
on the particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{F}\cdot{dr}=dt\boldsymbol{F}\cdot{v}=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>One should think about the implications of a velocity dependent
force. Suppose one had a constant magnetic field in deep space. If a
particle came through with velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_0\)</span>, it would undergo cyclotron
motion with radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R=v_0/\omega_c\)</span>. However, if it were still its
motion would remain fixed. Now, suppose an observer looked at the
particle in one reference frame where the particle was moving, then
changed their velocity so that the particle’s velocity appeared to be
zero. The motion would change from circular to fixed. Is this
possible?</p>
<p>The solution to the puzzle above relies on understanding
relativity. Imagine that the first observer believes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{B}\ne 0\)</span> and
that the electric field <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{E}=0\)</span>. If the observer then changes
reference frames by accelerating to a velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{v}\)</span>, in the new
frame <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{B}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{E}\)</span> both change. If the observer moved to the
frame where the charge, originally moving with a small velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>,
is now at rest, the new electric field is indeed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{v}\times\boldsymbol{B}\)</span>,
which then leads to the same acceleration as one had before. If the
velocity is not small compared to the speed of light, additional
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> factors come into play,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}\)</span>. Relativistic motion will not be
considered in this course.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.19. </span>Sliding Block tied to a Wall<a class="headerlink" href="#sliding-block-tied-to-a-wall" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another classical case is that of simple harmonic oscillations, here represented by a block sliding on a horizontal frictionless surface. The block is tied to a wall with a spring. If the spring is not compressed or stretched too far, the force on the block at a given position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
F=-kx.
\]</div>
<p>The negative sign means that the force acts to restore the object to an equilibrium position. Newton’s equation of motion for this idealized system is then</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kx,
\]</div>
<p>or we could rephrase it as</p>
<!-- Equation labels as ordinary links -->
<div id="eq:newton1"></div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\frac{k}{m}x=-\omega_0^2x,
\label{eq:newton1} \tag{19}
\]</div>
<p>with the angular frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega_0^2=k/m\)</span>.</p>
<p>The above differential equation has the advantage that it can be solved  analytically with solutions on the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
x(t)=Acos(\omega_0t+\nu),
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is the amplitude and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> the phase constant.   This provides in turn an important test for the numerical
solution and the development of a program for more complicated cases which cannot be solved analytically.</p>
<p>With the position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x(t)\)</span> and the velocity  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v(t)=dx/dt\)</span> we can reformulate Newton’s equation in the following way</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=v(t),
\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=-\omega_0^2x(t).
\]</div>
<p>We are now going to solve these equations using first the standard forward Euler  method. Later we will try to improve upon this.</p>
<p>Before proceeding however, it is important to note that in addition to the exact solution, we have at least two further tests which can be used to check our solution.</p>
<p>Since functions like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(cos\)</span> are periodic with a period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi\)</span>, then the solution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x(t)\)</span> has also to be periodic. This means that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
x(t+T)=x(t),
\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> the period defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{k/m}}.
\]</div>
<p>Observe that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> depends only on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k/m\)</span> and not on the amplitude of the solution.</p>
<p>In addition to the periodicity test, the total energy has also to be conserved.</p>
<p>Suppose we choose the initial conditions</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
x(t=0)=1\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{m}\hspace{1cm} v(t=0)=0\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{m/s},
\]</div>
<p>meaning that block is at rest at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span> but with a potential energy</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
E_0=\frac{1}{2}kx(t=0)^2=\frac{1}{2}k.
\]</div>
<p>The total energy at any time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> has however to be conserved, meaning that our solution has to fulfil the condition</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
E_0=\frac{1}{2}kx(t)^2+\frac{1}{2}mv(t)^2.
\]</div>
<p>We will derive this equation in our discussion on <a class="reference external" href="https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/energyconserv/html/energyconserv.html">energy conservation</a>.</p>
<p>An algorithm which implements these equations is included below.</p>
