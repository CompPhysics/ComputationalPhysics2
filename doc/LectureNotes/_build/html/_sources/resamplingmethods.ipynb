    "advantages: \n",
    "1. The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difficult to derive, even asymptotically. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap to complex data-collection plans (such as stratified and clustered samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap background\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\widehat{\\theta} = \\widehat{\\theta}(\\hat{X})$ is a function of random variables,\n",
    "$\\widehat{\\theta}$ itself must be a random variable. Thus it has\n",
    "a pdf, call this function $p(\\hat{t})$. The aim of the bootstrap is to\n",
    "estimate $p(\\hat{t})$ by the relative frequency of\n",
    "$\\widehat{\\theta}$. You can think of this as using a histogram\n",
    "in the place of $p(\\hat{t})$. If the relative frequency closely\n",

    "1. Draw with replacement $n$ numbers for the observed variables $\\hat{x} = (x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a vector $\\hat{x}^*$ containing the values which were drawn from $\\hat{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the vector $\\hat{x}^*$ compute $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$ by evaluating $\\widehat \\theta$ under the observations $\\hat{x}^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat this process $k$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done, you can draw a histogram of the relative frequency of $\\widehat \\theta^*$. This is your estimate of the probability distribution $p(t)$. Using this probability distribution you can estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the histogram of the relative frequency of $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$. Instead you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\\widehat \\theta$, apply the etsimator $\\widehat \\sigma^2$ to the values $\\widehat \\theta ^*$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following code starts with a Gaussian distribution with mean value $\\mu =100$ and variance $\\sigma=15$. We use this to generate the data used in the bootstrap analysis. The bootstrap analysis returns a data set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian, centered around the mean value $\\mu=100$ but with standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in this case the same as the number of original data points). The value of the standard deviation is what we expect from the central limit theorem."
