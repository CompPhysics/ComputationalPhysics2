1;95;0c# Schedule
This course will be delivered in a hybrid mode, with online and on site lectures and on site and online laboratory sessions. 

1. Two lectures per week, spring semester, 10 ECTS. The lectures will be fully online. The lectures will be recorded and linked to this site and the official University of Oslo website for the course;
2. Three hours of laboratory sessions for work on computational projects and exercises. There will  also be fully digital laboratory sessions for those who cannot attend. The first two weeks lectures and labs will be online;
3. Two projects which are graded and count 1/2 each of the final grade;
4. The course is offered as a FYS4411 (Master of Science level) and a FYS9411 (PhD level) course;
5. Videos of teaching material are available via the links at https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4411/v21/timeplan/index.html#FOR;
6. Weekly emails with summary of activities will be mailed to all participants;
