## Practicalities
This course will be delivered in a hybrid mode, with online and on site lectures and on site and online laboratory sessions. The first week (January 11-15) is fully digital and the computer lab and the lectures will be done via zoom. 

1. Two lectures per week, spring semester, 10 ECTS. The lectures will be fully online. The lectures will be recorded and linked to this site and the official University of Oslo website for the course;
2. Thre hours of laboratory sessions for work on computational projects and exercises for each group. Due to social distancing, at most 15 participants can attend. There will  also be fully digital laboratory sessions for those who cannot attend;
3. Two projects which are graded and count 1/2 each of the final grade;
4. The course is offered as a FYS4411 (Master of Science level) and a FYS9411 (PhD level) course;
5. Videos of teaching material are available via the links at https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4411/v21/timeplan/index.html#FOR;
6. Weekly emails with summary of activities will be mailed to all participants;

## Grading
Grading scale: Grades are awarded on a scale from A to F, where A is the best grade and F is a fail. There are two projects which are graded and each project counts 1/2 of the final grade. The total score is thus the average from the two  projects.

The final number of points is based on the average of all projects (including eventual additional points) and the grade follows the following table:

 * 92-100 points: A
 * 77-91 points: B
 * 58-76 points: C
 * 46-57 points: D
 * 40-45 points: E
 * 0-39 points: F-failed
