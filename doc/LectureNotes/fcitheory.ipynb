We will use here the simple pairing model to illustrate in particular how to set up a single-particle basis. We will also use this do discuss standard FCI approaches like:\n",

    "\n",
    "While the formalism is independent of the choice of basis, the **effectiveness** of a calculation \n",
    "will certainly be basis dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore there are common conventions useful to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the single-particle basis has angular momentum as a good quantum number.  You can \n",
    "imagine the single-particle wavefunctions being generated by a one-body Hamiltonian, \n",
    "for example a harmonic oscillator.  Modifications include harmonic oscillator plus \n",
    "spin-orbit splitting, or self-consistent mean-field potentials, or the Woods-Saxon potential which mocks \n",
    "up the self-consistent mean-field. \n",
    "For nuclei, the harmonic oscillator, modified by spin-orbit splitting, provides a useful language \n",
    "for describing single-particle states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "Each single-particle state is labeled by the following quantum numbers: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Orbital angular momentum $l$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intrinsic spin $s$ = 1/2 for protons and neutrons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Angular momentum $j = l \\pm 1/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $z$-component $j_z$ (or $m$)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some labeling of the radial wavefunction, typically $n$ the number of nodes in  the radial wavefunction, but in the case of harmonic oscillator one can also use the principal quantum number $N$, where the harmonic oscillator energy is $(N+3/2)\\hbar \\omega$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this format one labels states by $n(l)_j$, with $(l)$ replaced by a letter:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    " In practice the single-particle space has to be severely truncated.  This truncation is \n",
    "typically based upon the single-particle energies, which is the effective energy \n",
    "from a mean-field potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we freeze the core and only consider a valence space. For example, one \n",
    "may assume a frozen $^{4}\\mbox{He}$ core, with two protons and two neutrons in the $0s_{1/2}$ \n",
    "shell, and then only allow active particles in the $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits. \n",
    "\n",

    "$0d_{5/2}, 1s_{1/2}$ and $0d_{3/2}$ orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we refer to nuclei by the valence space where their last nucleons go.  \n",
    "So, for example, we call $^{12}\\mbox{C}$ a $p$-shell nucleus, while $^{26}\\mbox{Al}$ is an \n",
    "$sd$-shell nucleus and $^{56}\\mbox{Fe}$ is a $pf$-shell nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "There are different kinds of truncations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, one can start with `filled' orbits (almost always the lowest), and then  allow one, two, three... particles excited out of those filled orbits. These are called  1p-1h, 2p-2h, 3p-3h excitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternately, one can state a maximal orbit and allow all possible configurations with  particles occupying states up to that maximum. This is called *full configuration*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, for particular use in nuclear physics, there is the *energy* truncation, also  called the $N\\hbar\\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation.\n",

Although these solutions cannot always be computed exactly with radicals, they can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or Laguerre method, and in this way they are no different from solutions to polynomial equations of the second, third, or fourth degrees.\n",
