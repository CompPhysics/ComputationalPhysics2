===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock
Most quantum mechanical  problems of interest in for example atomic, molecular, nuclear and solid state 
physics consist of a large number of interacting electrons and ions or nucleons. 

The total number of particles $N$ is usually sufficiently large
that an exact solution cannot be found. 

Typically, 
the expectation value for a chosen hamiltonian for a system of  $N$ particles is
!bt
\[
   \langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}_1d\bm{R}_2\dots d\bm{R}_N
         \Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R_1},\bm{R}_2,\dots,\bm{R}_N)
          H(\bm{R_1},\bm{R}_2,\dots,\bm{R}_N)
          \Psi(\bm{R_1},\bm{R}_2,\dots,\bm{R}_N)}
        {\int d\bm{R}_1d\bm{R}_2\dots d\bm{R}_N
        \Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R_1},\bm{R}_2,\dots,\bm{R}_N)
        \Psi(\bm{R_1},\bm{R}_2,\dots,\bm{R}_N)},
\]
!et
an in general intractable problem.

 This integral is actually the starting point in a Variational Monte Carlo calculation. _Gaussian quadrature: Forget it_! Given 10 particles and 10 mesh points for each degree of freedom
and an
 ideal 1 Tflops machine (all operations take the same time), how long will it take to compute the above integral? The lifetime of the universe is of the order of $10^{17}$ s.

As an example from the nuclear many-body problem, we have Schroedinger's equation as a differential equation
!bt
\[
  \hat{H}\Psi(\bm{r}_1,..,\bm{r}_A,\alpha_1,..,\alpha_A)=E\Psi(\bm{r}_1,..,\bm{r}_A,\alpha_1,..,\alpha_A)
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
  \bm{r}_1,..,\bm{r}_A,
\]
!et
are the coordinates and 
!bt
\[
  \alpha_1,..,\alpha_A,
\]
!et
are sets of relevant quantum numbers such as spin and isospin for a system of  $A$ nucleons ($A=N+Z$, $N$ being the number of neutrons and $Z$ the number of protons).

There are
!bt
\[
 2^A\times \left(\begin{array}{c} A\\ Z\end{array}\right)
\]
!et
coupled second-order differential equations in $3A$ dimensions.

For a nucleus like ${}^{10}\mbox{Be}$ this number is _215040_.
This is a truely challenging many-body problem.

Methods like partial differential equations can at most be used for 2-3 particles.

* Monte-Carlo methods
* Renormalization group (RG) methods, in particular density matrix RG
* Large-scale diagonalization (Iterative methods, Lanczo's method, dimensionalities  $10^{10}$ states)
* Coupled cluster theory, favoured method in quantum chemistry, molecular and atomic physics. Applications to ab initio calculations in nuclear physics as well for large nuclei.
* Perturbative many-body methods 
* Green's function methods
* Density functional theory/Mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock theory

The physics of the system hints at which many-body methods to use.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Pros and Cons of Monte Carlo
* Is physically intuitive.
* Allows one to study systems with many degrees of freedom. Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) yield in principle the exact solution to Schroedinger's equation.
* Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) is easy  to implement but needs a reliable trial wave function, can be difficult to obtain.  This is where we will use Hartree-Fock theory to construct an optimal basis.
* DMC/GFMC for fermions (spin with half-integer values, electrons, baryons, neutrinos, quarks)  has a sign problem. Nature prefers an anti-symmetric wave function. PDF in this case given distribution of random walkers ($p\ge 0$).
* The solution has a statistical error, which can be large. 
* There is a limit for how large systems one can study, DMC needs a huge number of random walkers in order to achieve stable results. 
* Obtain only the lowest-lying states with a given symmetry. Can get excited states.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Where and why do we use Monte Carlo Methods in Quantum Physics
* Quantum systems with many particles at finite temperature: Path Integral Monte Carlo with applications to dense matter and quantum liquids (phase transitions from normal fluid to superfluid). Strong correlations.
* Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases, method transition from  non-linear PDE to Diffusion Monte Carlo as density increases.
* Light atoms, molecules, solids and nuclei. 
* Lattice Quantum-Chromo Dynamics. Impossible to solve without MC calculations. 
* Simulations of systems in solid state physics, from semiconductors to spin systems. Many electrons active and possibly strong correlations.

Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   E[H]= \langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle H \rangle .
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.
!eblock

!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock
The trial wave function can be expanded in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian since they form a complete set, viz.,
!bt
\[
   \Psi_T(\bm{R})=\sum_i a_i\Psi_i(\bm{R}),
\]
!et
and assuming the set of eigenfunctions to be normalized one obtains 
!bt
\[
     \frac{\sum_{nm}a^*_ma_n \int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_m(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})}
        {\sum_{nm}a^*_ma_n \int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_m(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})} =\frac{\sum_{n}a^2_n E_n}
        {\sum_{n}a^2_n} \ge E_0,
\]
!et
where we used that $H(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})=E_n\Psi_n(\bm{R})$.
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation
values  are multi-dimensional ones. 
The variational principle yields the lowest state of a given symmetry.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock
In most cases, a wave function has only small values in large parts of 
configuration space, and a straightforward procedure which uses
homogenously distributed random points in configuration space 
will most likely lead to poor results. This may suggest that some kind
of importance sampling combined with e.g., the Metropolis algorithm 
may be  a more efficient way of obtaining the ground state energy.
The hope is then that those regions of configurations space where
the wave function assumes appreciable values are sampled more 
efficiently.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====

The tedious part in a VMC calculation is the search for the variational
minimum. A good knowledge of the system is required in order to carry out
reasonable VMC calculations. This is not always the case, 
and often VMC calculations 
serve rather as the starting
point for so-called diffusion Monte Carlo calculations (DMC). DMC is a way of
solving exactly the many-body Schroedinger equation by means of 
a stochastic procedure. A good guess on the binding energy
and its wave function is however necessary. 
A carefully performed VMC calculation can aid in this context.

* Construct first a trial wave function $\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})$,  for a many-body system consisting of $N$ particles located at positions 
$\bm{R}=(\bm{R}_1,\dots ,\bm{R}_N)}$. The trial wave function depends on $\alpha$ variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\dots ,\alpha_M)$.
* Then we evaluate the expectation value of the hamiltonian $H$ 
!bt
\[
   E[H]=\langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
* Thereafter we vary $\alpha$ according to some minimization algorithm and return to the first step.

Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.

This is our new probability distribution function  (PDF).
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   E[H(\bm{\alpha})] = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}

called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
