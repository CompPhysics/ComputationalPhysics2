    "Present CPUs are highly parallel processors with varying levels of parallelism. The typical situation can be described via the following three statements.\n",
    "* Pursuit of shorter computation time and larger simulation size gives rise to parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple processors are involved to solve a global problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The essence is to divide the entire computation evenly among collaborative processors.  Divide and conquer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed with a more detailed discussion of topics like vectorization and parallelization, we need to remind ourselves about some basic features of different hardware models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A rough classification of hardware models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conventional single-processor computers are named SISD (single-instruction-single-data) machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) machines incorporate the idea of parallel processing, using a large number of processing units to execute the same instruction on different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern parallel computers are so-called MIMD (multiple-instruction-multiple-data) machines and can execute different instruction streams in parallel on different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared memory and distributed memory\n",
    "One way of categorizing modern parallel computers is to look at the memory configuration.\n",
    "* In shared memory systems the CPUs share the same address space. Any CPU can access any data in the global memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In distributed memory systems each CPU has its own memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPUs are connected by some network and may exchange messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different parallel programming paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task parallelism**:  the work of a global problem can be divided into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize.  Monte Carlo simulations represent a typical situation. Integration is another. However this paradigm is of limited use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data parallelism**:  use of multiple threads (e.g. one or more threads per processor) to dissect loops over arrays etc.  Communication and synchronization between processors are often hidden, thus easy to program. However, the user surrenders much control to a specialized compiler. Examples of data parallelism are compiler-based parallelization and OpenMP directives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different parallel programming paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Message passing**:  all involved processors have an independent memory address space. The user is responsible for  partitioning the data/work of a global problem and distributing the  subproblems to the processors. Collaboration between processors is achieved by explicit message passing, which is used for data transfer plus synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This paradigm is the most general one where the user has full control. Better parallel efficiency is usually achieved by explicit message passing. However, message-passing programming is more difficult.\n",
