    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",

Using this probability distribution you can estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the histogram of the relative frequency of $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$. Instead you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\\widehat \\theta$, apply the etsimator $\\widehat \\sigma^2$ to the values $\\widehat \\theta ^*$.\n",

    "The following code starts with a Gaussian distribution with mean value $\\mu =100$ and variance $\\sigma=15$. We use this to generate the data used in the bootstrap analysis. The bootstrap analysis returns a data set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian, centered around the mean value $\\mu=100$ but with standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in this case the same as the number of original data points). The value of the standard deviation is what we expect from the central limit theorem."
