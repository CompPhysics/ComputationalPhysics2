    "## Motivation\n",
    "Our aim with this part of the project is to be able to\n",
    "* find an optimal value for the variational parameters using only some few Monte Carlo cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "* use these optimal values for the variational parameters to perform a large-scale Monte Carlo calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this will look at methods like *Steepest descent* and the *conjugate gradient method*. Both these methods allow us to find\n",
    "the minima of a multivariable  function like our energy (function of several variational parameters). \n",
    "Alternatively, you can always use Newton's method. In particular, since we will only have one variational parameter,\n",
    "Newton's method can be easily used in finding the minimum of the local energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple example and demonstration\n",
