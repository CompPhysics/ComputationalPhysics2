    "\n",
    "These notebooks serve the aim of linking traditional variational Monte\n",
    "Carlo VMC calculations methods with recent progress on solving\n",
    "many-particle problems using Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when linking with Machine Learning algorithms, in particular\n",
    "so-called Boltzmann Machines, there are interesting connections between\n",
    "these algorithms and so-called [Shadow Wave functions (SWFs)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.053304) (and references therein). The implications of the latter have been explored in various Monte Carlo calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In total there are three notebooks:\n",
    "1. notebook 1 on Variational Monte Carlo methods, \n",
    "\n",
    "2. the one you are reading now, notebook 2 on Machine Learning and quantum mechanical problems and in particular on Boltzmann Machines, \n",
    "\n",
    "3. and finally notebook 3 on the link between Boltzmann machines and SWFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebook 1 we gave an introduction with code examples on how to\n",
    "develop a professional variational Monte Carlo program. The intention\n",
    "behind that material was to bridge the gap between traditional Monte\n",
    "Carlo calculations and Machine Learning methods. In particular, as\n",
    "will be the case here, the provide a link between neural networks with\n",
    "so-called Boltzmann machines and many of the basic ingredients in a\n",
    "variational MC calculation.  The most important ingredients we\n",
    "discussed in notebook 1 were\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The definition of the cost function (the energy as function of the variational parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimization methods like gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Metropolis sampling (and later also Gibbs sampling) and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "We will meet these concepts again here. However, in order to provide\n",
    "the reader with a relevant background, we start by reviewing some\n",
    "basic properties of neural networks. Thereafter we jump in the world\n",
    "of Boltzmann machines and use these to study interacting many-body\n",
    "problems. Notebook 3 explores so-called shadow wave functions applied\n",
    "to Monte Carlo claculations. We will see that they are rather close to\n",
    "the concept of Boltzmann machines.\n",
