    "\n",
    "### Structure and Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks serve the aim of linking traditional variational Monte\n",
    "Carlo VMC calculations methods with recent progress on solving\n",
    "many-particle problems using Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when linking with Machine Learning algorithms, in particular\n",
    "so-called Boltzmann Machines, there are interesting connections between\n",
    "these algorithms and so-called [Shadow Wave functions (SWFs)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.053304) (and references therein). The implications of the latter have been explored in various Monte Carlo calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In total there are three notebooks:\n",
    "1. notebook 1 on Variational Monte Carlo methods, \n",
    "\n",
    "2. the one you are reading now, notebook 2 on Machine Learning and quantum mechanical problems and in particular on Boltzmann Machines, \n",
    "\n",
    "3. and finally notebook 3 on the link between Boltzmann machines and SWFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebook 1 we gave an introduction with code examples on how to\n",
    "develop a professional variational Monte Carlo program. The intention\n",
    "behind that material was to bridge the gap between traditional Monte\n",
    "Carlo calculations and Machine Learning methods. In particular, as\n",
    "will be the case here, the provide a link between neural networks with\n",
    "so-called Boltzmann machines and many of the basic ingredients in a\n",
    "variational MC calculation.  The most important ingredients we\n",
    "discussed in notebook 1 were\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The definition of the cost function (the energy as function of the variational parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimization methods like gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Metropolis sampling (and later also Gibbs sampling) and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "We will meet these concepts again here. However, in order to provide\n",
    "the reader with a relevant background, we start by reviewing some\n",
    "basic properties of neural networks. Thereafter we jump in the world\n",
    "of Boltzmann machines and use these to study interacting many-body\n",
    "problems. Notebook 3 explores so-called shadow wave functions applied\n",
    "to Monte Carlo claculations. We will see that they are rather close to\n",
    "the concept of Boltzmann machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Other unsupervised learning algortihms, here Boltzmann machines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Boltzmann machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a lot of attention lately. \n",
    "One of the major reasons is that they can be stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture complicated statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous data that are common to natural images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use a generative model rather than the more well known discriminative deep neural networks (DNN)? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Discriminitave methods have several limitations: They are mainly supervised learning methods, thus requiring labeled data. And there are tasks they cannot accomplish, like drawing new examples from an unknown probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model of the probability distribution from which the training data was drawn. As an example\n",
    "\n",
    "a. A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered Ising model phase, having been given samples of such phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Model the trial function for Monte Carlo calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Both use gradient-descent based learning procedures for minimizing cost functions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Energy based models don't use backpropagation and automatic differentiation for computing gradients, instead turning to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DNNs often have several hidden layers. A restricted Boltzmann machine has only one hidden layer, however several RBMs can be stacked to make up Deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute the building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "History: The RBM was developed by amongst others Geoffrey Hinton, called by some the \"Godfather of Deep Learning\", working with the University of Toronto and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A BM is what we would call an undirected probabilistic graphical model\n",
    "with stochastic continuous or discrete units.\n",
    "It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the\n",
    "state of each unit(neurons/nodes) depends on the units it is connected\n",
    "to. The weights in the network represent thus the strength of the\n",
    "interaction between various units/nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns into a Hopfield network if we choose deterministic rather\n",
    "than stochastic units. In contrast to a Hopfield network, a BM is a\n",
    "so-called generative model. It allows us to generate new samples from\n",
    "the learned distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\\hat{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\\hat{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.\n",
    "Here we take away all lateral connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections between nodes in the hidden layer. The network is illustrated in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network layers**:\n",
    "1. A function $\\mathbf{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function $\\mathbf{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called \"feature detectors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized over (integrated out).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of this trick being employed in physics: \n",
    "1. The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The introduction of ghost fields in gauge theory\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shadow wave functions in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network parameters, to be optimized/learned**:\n",
    "1. $\\mathbf{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\mathbf{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\\mathbf{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\\times N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Boltzmann distribution"

Our goal is to test the method on systems of moving particles. For the spin lattice systems it was natural to use a binary-binary RBM, with the nodes taking values of 1 and -1. For moving particles, on the other hand, we want the visible nodes to be continuous, representing position coordinates. Thus, we start by choosing a Gaussian-binary RBM, where the visible nodes are continuous and hidden nodes take on values of 0 or 1. If eventually we would like the hidden nodes to be continuous as well the rectified linear units seem like the most relevant choice.\n",
