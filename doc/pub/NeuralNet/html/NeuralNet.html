<h2 id="___sec0">What is Machine Learning? </h2>

<p>
Machine learning is the science of giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
The idea is that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns in a broad class of data sets without 
having to write code specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic based on the data.

<p>
Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely related to computational statistics. 
It evolved from the study of pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has made contributions to
AI tasks like computer vision, natural language processing 
and speech recognition. It has also, especially in later years, 
found applications in a wide variety of other areas, including bioinformatics, economy, physics, finance and marketing.

<p>

<h2 id="___sec1">Types of Machine Learning </h2>

<p>
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em>
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

<p>
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

<ul>
  <li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>
  <li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>
  <li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec2">Artificial neurons  </h2>
The field of artificial neural networks has a long history of development, and is closely connected with 
the advancement of computer science and computers in general. A model of artificial neurons 
was first developed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943  to study signal processing in the brain and 
has later been refined by others. The general idea is to mimic neural networks in the human brain, which
is composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other by sending electrical signals. 
Each neuron accumulates its incoming signals, 
which must exceed an activation threshold to yield an output. If the threshold is not overcome, the neuron
remains inactive, i.e. has zero output.

<p>
This behaviour has inspired a simple mathematical model for an artificial neuron.

$$
\begin{equation}
 y = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i\right) = f(u)
\label{artificialNeuron}
\end{equation}
$$

Here, the output \( y \) of the neuron is the value of its activation function, which have as input
a weighted sum of signals \( x_i, \dots ,x_n \) received by \( n \) other neurons.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec3">Neural network types </h2>

<p>
An artificial neural network (NN), is a computational model that consists of layers of connected neurons, or <em>nodes</em>. 
It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each neuron interact with other neurons
by sending signals in the form of mathematical functions between layers. 
A wide variety of different NNs have
been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer, an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called
<em>hidden layers</em>. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each connection between two nodes
is associated with a weight variable.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec4">Feed-forward neural networks </h2>
The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type of NN devised. In this network, 
the information moves in only one direction: forward through the layers.

<p>
Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the connections between the nodes, including the 
direction of information flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable, not displayed here. 
We observe that each node in a layer is connected to <em>all</em> nodes in the subsequent layer, 
making this a so-called <em>fully-connected</em> FFNN.

<p>
A different variant of FFNNs are <em>convolutional neural networks</em> (CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern
inspired by the animal visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to stimuli from
small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong
spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of each neuron can be approximated mathematically 
as a convolution operation.

<p>
CNNs emulate the behaviour of neurons in the visual cortex by enforcing a <em>local</em> connectivity pattern
between nodes of adjacent layers: Each node
in a convolutional layer is connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, 
in contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.
Often, CNNs 
consist of several convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a fully-connected layer at the end, 
which gathers all the local data and produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video recognition

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec5">Recurrent neural networks </h2>

<p>
So far we have only mentioned NNs where information flows in one direction: forward. <em>Recurrent neural networks</em> on
the other hand, have connections between nodes that form directed <em>cycles</em>. This creates a form of 
internal memory which are able to capture information on what has been calculated before; the output is dependent 
on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of sequential information by performing the same task for 
every element in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An example of such information is 
sentences, making recurrent NNs especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec6">Other types of networks </h2>

<p>
There are many other kinds of NNs that have been developed. One type that is specifically designed for interpolation
in multidimensional space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically made up of three layers: 
an input layer, a hidden layer with non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output layer (''linear'' here
means that each node in the output layer has a linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected and 
there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as
a separate type of NN due the unusual activation functions.

<p>
Other types of NNs could also be mentioned, but are outside the scope of this work. We will now move on to a detailed description
of how a fully-connected FFNN works, and how it can be used to interpolate data sets.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec7">Multilayer perceptrons  </h2>

<p>
One use often so-called  fully-connected feed-forward neural networks with three
or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer)
consisting of neurons that have non-linear activation functions.

<p>
Such networks are often called <em>multilayer perceptrons</em> (MLPs)

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec8">Why multilayer perceptrons?  </h2>

<p>
According to the <em>Universal approximation theorem</em>, a feed-forward neural network with just a single hidden layer containing 
a finite number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional function to arbitrary accuracy, 
assuming the activation function for the hidden layer is a <b>non-constant, bounded and monotonically-increasing continuous function</b>.
Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to the hidden layer, the output nodes are always
assumed to be linear, so as to not restrict the range of output values.

<p>
We note that this theorem is only applicable to a NN with <em>one</em> hidden layer. 
Therefore, we can easily construct an NN 
that employs activation functions which do not satisfy the above requirements, as long as we have at least one layer
with activation functions that <em>do</em>. Furthermore, although the universal approximation theorem
lays the theoretical foundation for regression with neural networks, it does not say anything about how things work in practice: 
A neural network can still be able to approximate a given function reasonably well without having the flexibility to fit <em>all other</em>
functions.

<p>

<h2 id="___sec9">Mathematical model  </h2>

$$
\begin{equation}
 y = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i + b_i\right) = f(u)
\label{artificialNeuron2}
\end{equation}
$$

In an FFNN of such neurons, the <em>inputs</em> \( x_i \)
are the <em>outputs</em> of the neurons in the preceding layer. Furthermore, an MLP is fully-connected, 
which means that each neuron receives a weighted sum of the outputs of <em>all</em> neurons in the previous layer.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec10">Mathematical model  </h2>

<p>
First, for each node \( i \) in the first hidden layer, we calculate a weighted sum \( u_i^1 \) of the input coordinates \( x_j \),

$$
\begin{equation}
 u_i^1 = \sum_{j=1}^2 w_{ij}^1 x_j  + b_i^1 
\label{_auto1}
\end{equation}
$$

This value is the argument to the activation function \( f_1 \) of each neuron \( i \),
producing the output \( y_i^1 \) of all neurons in layer 1,

$$
\begin{equation}
 y_i^1 = f_1(u_i^1) = f_1\left(\sum_{j=1}^2 w_{ij}^1 x_j  + b_i^1\right)
\label{outputLayer1}
\end{equation}
$$

where we assume that all nodes in the same layer have identical activation functions, hence the notation \( f_l \)

$$
\begin{equation}
 y_i^l = f_l(u_i^l) = f_l\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N_{l-1}} w_{ij}^l y_j^{l-1} + b_i^l\right)
\label{generalLayer}
\end{equation}
$$

where \( N_l \) is the number of nodes in layer \( l \). When the output of all the nodes in the first hidden layer are computed,
the values of the subsequent layer can be calculated and so forth until the output is obtained.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec11">Mathematical model  </h2>

<p>
The output of neuron \( i \) in layer 2 is thus,

$$
\begin{align}
 y_i^2 &= f_2\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 w_{ij}^2 y_j^1 + b_i^2\right) 
\label{_auto2}\\
 &= f_2\left[\sum_{j=1}^3 w_{ij}^2f_1\left(\sum_{k=1}^2 w_{jk}^1 x_k + b_j^1\right) + b_i^2\right]
\label{outputLayer2}
\end{align}
$$

where we have substituted \( y_m^1 \) with. Finally, the NN output yields,

$$
\begin{align}
 y_1^3 &= f_3\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 w_{1m}^3 y_j^2 + b_1^3\right) 
\label{_auto3}\\
 &= f_3\left[\sum_{j=1}^3 w_{1j}^3 f_2\left(\sum_{k=1}^3 w_{jk}^2 f_1\left(\sum_{m=1}^2 w_{km}^1 x_m + b_k^1\right) + b_j^2\right)
  + b_1^3\right]
\label{_auto4}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec12">Mathematical model  </h2>

<p>
We can generalize this expression to an MLP with \( l \) hidden layers. The complete functional form
is,
$$
\begin{align}
&y^{l+1}_1\! = \!f_{l+1}\!\left[\!\sum_{j=1}^{N_l}\! w_{1j}^3 f_l\!\left(\!\sum_{k=1}^{N_{l-1}}\! w_{jk}^2 f_{l-1}\!\left(\!
 \dots \!f_1\!\left(\!\sum_{n=1}^{N_0} \!w_{mn}^1 x_n\! + \!b_m^1\!\right)
 \!\dots \!\right) \!+ \!b_k^2\!\right)
 \!+ \!b_1^3\!\right] &&
\label{completeNN}
\end{align}
$$

which illustrates a basic property of MLPs: The only independent variables are the input values \( x_n \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec13">Mathematical model  </h2>

<p>
This confirms that an MLP,
despite its quite convoluted mathematical form, is nothing more than an analytic function, specifically a 
mapping of real-valued vectors \( \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m \). 
In our example, \( n=2 \) and \( m=1 \). Consequentially, 
the number of input and output values of the function we want to fit must be equal to the number of inputs and outputs of our MLP.

<p>
Furthermore, the flexibility and universality of a MLP can be illustrated by realizing that 
the expression  is essentially a nested sum of scaled activation functions of the form

$$
\begin{equation}
 h(x) = c_1 f(c_2 x + c_3) + c_4
\label{_auto5}
\end{equation}
$$

where the parameters \( c_i \) are weights and biases. By adjusting these parameters, the activation functions
can be shifted up and down or left and right, change slope or be rescaled 
which is the key to the flexibility of a neural network.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3 id="___sec14">Matrix-vector notation </h3>

We can introduce a more convenient notation for the activations in a NN.

<p>
Additionally, we can represent the biases and activations
as layer-wise column vectors \( \vec{b}_l \) and \( \vec{y}_l \), so that the \( i \)-th element of each vector 
is the bias \( b_i^l \) and activation \( y_i^l \) of node \( i \) in layer \( l \) respectively.

<p>
We have that \( \mathrm{W}_l \) is a \( N_{l-1} \times N_l \) matrix, while \( \vec{b}_l \) and \( \vec{y}_l \) are \( N_l \times 1 \) column vectors. 
With this notation, the sum in  becomes a matrix-vector multiplication, and we can write
the equation for the activations of hidden layer 2 in
$$
\begin{equation}
 \vec{y}_2 = f_2(\mathrm{W}_2 \vec{y}_{1} + \vec{b}_{2}) = 
 f_2\left(\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    w^2_{11} &w^2_{12} &w^2_{13} \\
    w^2_{21} &w^2_{22} &w^2_{23} \\
    w^2_{31} &w^2_{32} &w^2_{33} \\
    \end{array} \right] \cdot
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
           y^1_1 \\
           y^1_2 \\
           y^1_3 \\
          \end{array}\right] + 
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
           b^2_1 \\
           b^2_2 \\
           b^2_3 \\
          \end{array}\right]\right).
\label{_auto6}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3 id="___sec15">Matrix-vector notation  and activation </h3>

The activation of node \( i \) in layer 2 is

$$
\begin{equation}
 y^2_i = f_2\Bigr(w^2_{i1}y^1_1 + w^2_{i2}y^1_2 + w^2_{i3}y^1_3 + b^2_i\Bigr) = 
 f_2\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 w^2_{ij} y_j^1 + b^2_i\right).
\label{_auto7}
\end{equation}
$$

This is not just a convenient and compact notation, but also 
a useful and intuitive way to think about MLPs: The output is calculated by a series of matrix-vector multiplications
and vector additions that are used as input to the activation functions. For each operation 
\( \mathrm{W}_l \vec{y}_{l-1} \) we move forward one layer.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3 id="___sec16">Activation functions  </h3>

<p>
A property that characterizes a neural network, other than its connectivity, is the choice of activation function(s). 
As described in, the following restrictions are imposed on an activation function for a FFNN
to fulfill the universal approximation theorem

<ul>
  <li> Non-constant</li>
  <li> Bounded</li>
  <li> Monotonically-increasing</li>
  <li> Continuous</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3 id="___sec17">Activation functions, Logistic and Hyperbolic ones  </h3>

<p>
The second requirement excludes all linear functions. Furthermore, in a MLP with only linear activation functions, each 
layer simply performs a linear transformation of its inputs.

<p>
Regardless of the number of layers, 
the output of the NN will be nothing but a linear function of the inputs. Thus we need to introduce some kind of 
non-linearity to the NN to be able to fit non-linear functions
Typical examples are the logistic <em>Sigmoid</em>
$$
\begin{equation}
 f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}},
\label{sigmoidActivationFunction}
\end{equation}
$$

and the <em>hyperbolic tangent</em> function
$$
\begin{equation}
 f(x) = \tanh(x)
\label{tanhActivationFunction}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3 id="___sec18">Relevance </h3>

The <em>sigmoid</em> function are more biologically plausible because 
the output of inactive neurons are zero. Such activation function are called <em>one-sided</em>. However,
it has been shown  that the hyperbolic tangent 
performs better than the sigmoid for training MLPs. 
has become the most popular  for <em>deep neural networks</em>
