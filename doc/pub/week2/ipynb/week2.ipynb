    "\n",
    "### Structure and Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks serve the aim of linking traditional variational Monte\n",
    "Carlo VMC calculations methods with recent progress on solving\n",
    "many-particle problems using Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when linking with Machine Learning algorithms, in particular\n",
    "so-called Boltzmann Machines, there are interesting connections between\n",
    "these algorithms and so-called [Shadow Wave functions (SWFs)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.053304) (and references therein). The implications of the latter have been explored in various Monte Carlo calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In total there are three notebooks:\n",
    "1. the one you are reading now on Variational Monte Carlo methods, \n",
    "\n",
    "2. notebook 2 on Machine Learning and quantum mechanical problems and in particular on Boltzmann Machines, \n",
    "\n",
    "3. and finally notebook 3 on the link between Boltzmann machines and SWFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook the aim is to give you an introduction as well as an\n",
    "understanding of the basic elements that are needed in order to\n",
    "develop a professional variational Monte Carlo code. We will focus on\n",
    "a simple system of two particles in an oscillator trap (or\n",
    "alternatively two fermions moving in a Coulombic potential). The particles can\n",
    "interact via a repulsive or an attrative force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of these systems is that for two particles (boson or\n",
    "fermions) we have analytical solutions for the eigenpairs of the\n",
    "non-interacting case. Furthermore, for a two- or three-dimensional\n",
    "system of two electrons moving in a harmonic oscillator trap, we have\n",
    "[analytical solutions for the interacting case as well](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/27/3/040/meta).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Having analytical eigenpairs is an invaluable feature that allows us \n",
    "to assess the physical relevance of the trial wave functions, be\n",
    "these either from a standard VMC procedure, from Boltzmann Machines or\n",
    "from Shadow Wave functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we start with the basics of a VMC calculation and\n",
    "introduce concepts like Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and the\n",
    "Metropolis algorithm, importance sampling and Metropolis-Hastings\n",
    "algorithm, resampling methods to obtain better estimates of the\n",
    "statistical errors and minimization of the expectation values of the\n",
    "energy and the variance. The latter is done in order to obtain the\n",
    "best possible variational parameters. Furthermore it will define the\n",
    "so-called **cost** function, a commonly encountered quantity in Machine\n",
    "Learning algorithms. Minimizing the latter is the one which leads to\n",
    "the determination of the optimal parameters in basically all Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "For our purposes, it will serve as the first link between VMC methods and Machine Learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics like Markov Chain Monte Carlo and various resampling techniques\n",
    "are also central to Machine Learning methods. Presenting them in the\n",
    "context of VMC approaches leads hopefully to an easier starting point\n",
    "for the understanding of these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the reader may ask what do we actually want to achieve with\n",
    "complicating life with Machine Learning methods when we can easily\n",
    "study interacting systems with standard Monte Carlo approaches.  Our\n",
    "hope is that by adding additional degrees of freedom via Machine\n",
    "Learning algorithms, we can let the algorithms we employ learn the\n",
    "parameters of the model via a given optimization algorithm. In\n",
    "standard Monte Carlo calculations the practitioners end up with fine tuning\n",
    "the trial wave function using all possible insights about the system\n",
    "understudy. This may not always lead to the best possible ansatz and\n",
    "can in the long run be rather time-consuming. In fields like nuclear\n",
    "many-body physics with complicated interaction terms, guessing an\n",
    "analytical form for the trial wave fuction can be difficult. Letting\n",
    "the machine learn the form of the trial function or find the optimal\n",
    "parameters may lead to insights about the problem which cannot be\n",
    "obtained by selecting various trial wave functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emerging and rapidly expanding fields of Machine Learning and Quantum Computing hold also great promise in tackling the \n",
    "dimensionality problems (the so-called dimensionality curse in many-body problems) we encounter when studying \n",
    "complicated many-body problems. \n",
    "The approach to Machine Learning we will focus on \n",
    " is inspired by the idea of representing the wave function with\n",
    "a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), presented recently by [G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science **355**, Issue 6325, pp. 602-606 (2017)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602). They\n",
    "named such a wave function/network a *neural network quantum state* (NQS). In their article they apply it to the quantum mechanical\n",
    "spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with\n",
    "encouraging results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young age. The\n",
    "increases we have seen during the last three decades in computational\n",
    "capabilities have been followed by developments of methods and\n",
    "techniques for analyzing and handling large data sets, relying heavily\n",
    "on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The field is rather\n",
    "new and developing rapidly. \n",
    "Machine learning is the science of giving computers the ability to\n",
    "learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is that there\n",
    "exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns in a broad\n",
    "class of data sets without having to write code specifically for each\n",
    "problem. The algorithm will build its own logic based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. It has also, especially in later\n",
    "years, found applications in a wide variety of other areas, including\n",
    "bioinformatics, economy, physics, finance and marketing.\n",
    "An excellent reference we will come to back to is [Mehta *et al.*, arXiv:1803.08823](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823).\n",
