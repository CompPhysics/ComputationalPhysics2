    "## Resampling methods\n",
    "Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern\n",
    "statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training\n",
    "set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to\n",
    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",
    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive\n",
    "Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they\n",
    "involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using\n",
    "different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent\n",
    "advances in computing power, the computational requirements of\n",
    "resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we\n",
    "discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools\n",
    "in the practical application of many statistical learning\n",
    "procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the\n",
    "test error associated with a given statistical learning method in\n",
    "order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level\n",
    "of flexibility. The process of evaluating a modelâ€™s performance is\n",
    "known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper\n",

    "The following code starts with a Gaussian distribution with mean value $\\mu =100$ and variance $\\sigma=15$. We use this to generate the data used in the bootstrap analysis. The bootstrap analysis returns a data set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian, centered around the mean value $\\mu=100$ but with standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in this case the same as the number of original data points). The value of the standard deviation is what we expect from the central limit theorem."
